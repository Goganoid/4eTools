When the battle was over, every demon had fallen, every tiefling—and every dragonborn but one. Wounded, he still lifted his commander's tattered standard before he set out for home. His people kept the banner as a sign of the victory. It disappeared with the fall of Arkhosia, but has reappeared throughout the centuries, infused with powers that bolster the righteous in their battle against evil. The Standard is a banner flying atop a pole of oak.

A unique stone without copy or sibling, it is thought that Ioun crafted it at the behest of Zehir, deity of darkness, poison, and assassins. The lord of knowledge might have felt compelled to create the Stone so that Zehir could use it in the pursuit of understanding—even if that learning involved better ways to find and kill his victims. In truth, the Stone proved a powerful tool, often bestowed directly by Zehir upon a worthy follower to aid in a particularly dangerous assassination attempt.<bt>Invested with a sizable portion of Ioun's magical energy, the Stone gained a semblance of self-awareness. After years of aiding in the murder of so many, the Stone has seen its personality become twisted and darkened. Its reputation has grown as well.

However, closer scrutiny reveals that the pieces of the raiment are untouched by mortal tools, appearing instead as though they were grown as living objects.<br>    Wardens benefit the most from the Raiment of the World Spirit set, but defenders and classes that grant access to polymorph powers will find these items useful as well.</p><h3>Raiment of the World Spirit Items</h3><table class=ignore><tr><th class=miset>Lvl</th><th class=miset>Name</th><th class=miset>Price (gp)</th><th class=miset>Item Slot</th><tr><td>12+<td>Necklace of Fate<td>13000<td>Neck<tr><td>13<td>Shield of the World Tree<td>17000<td>Arms<tr><td>14<td>Mask of the Vengeful Spirit<td>21000<td>Head<tr><td>15<td>Ring of Many Forms<td>25000<td>Ring</table><h3>Raiment of the World Spirit Benefits</h3><table class=ignore><tr><th class=miset>Pieces</th><th class=miset>Benefit</th><tr><td>2<td>You gain an item bonus to saving throws against ongoing damage equal to the number of items you have from this set.<tr><td>4<td>Your healing surge value increases by 4.</table><h1 class=mihead>Necklace of Fate<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 12+ Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This necklace of acorns and woven vines tethers your spirit to nature, helping you shake off the effects of combat.</p><table class=magicitem><tr><td class=mic1>Lvl 12<td class=mic2>+3<td class=mic3>13,000 gp<td class=mic4> <td class=mic1>Lvl 22<td class=mic2>+5<td class=mic3>325,000 gp<tr><td class=mic1>Lvl 17<td class=mic2>+4<td class=mic3>65,000 gp<td class=mic4> <td class=mic1>Lvl 27<td class=mic2>+6<td class=mic3>1,625,000 gp</table><p class=mistat><b>Neck Slot</b></p><p class=mistat><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> Fortitude, Reflex, and Will</p><h2 class=mihead>Power ✦ Encounter (No Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent1'><i>Trigger:</i> You make a saving throw at a time other than the end of your turn.</p><p class='mistat indent1'><i>Effect:</i> You gain an item bonus to that saving throw equal to the necklace's enhancement bonus.</p><br><br><h1 class=mihead>Shield of the World Tree<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 13 Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>When you make use of healing energy, the magic within this solid heartwood shield protects your allies.</p><p class=mistat><b>Arms Slot: </b>Any shield        17,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Property</h2><p class=mistat>When you spend a healing surge, each ally adjacent to you gains a +2 shield bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.<br></p><br><br><h1 class=mihead>Mask of the Vengeful Spirit<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 14 Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This wooden mask takes on the appearance of a snarling beast, causing a selected foe to be overcome by fear.</p><p class=mistat><b>Head Slot</b>        21,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Power (Fear) ✦ Daily (No Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'>When you roll initiative, you mark one enemy you can see, and that enemy grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.</p><br><br><h1 class=mihead>Ring of Many Forms<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 15 Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This ring appears as a band of shifting energy, sharpening your combat prowess when you wield the magic of transformation.</p><p class=mistat><b>Ring Slot</b>        25,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Property</h2><p class=mistat>When you use a polymorph power, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your turn.<br></p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault 2, page(s) 120.</p>","item341":"<h1 class=player>Palisade fort</h1><br><b>Category</b>: Building<br><b>Price</b>: 25,000 gp <br><b>Description</b>: Surrounded by a wall of sharpened logs, this wooden fort can be constructed quickly and garrisons up to fifty troops and their families.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, page(s) 128.</p>","item821":"<h1 class=mihead>Brooch of No Regrets<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 3+ Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This ornate golden shield pin bolsters your allies even in dire circumstances.</p><table class=magicitem><tr><td class=mic1>Lvl 3<td class=mic2>+1<td class=mic3>680 gp<td class=mic4> <td class=mic1>Lvl 18<td class=mic2>+4<td class=mic3>85,000 gp<tr><td class=mic1>Lvl 8<td class=mic2>+2<td class=mic3>3,400 gp<td class=mic4> <td class=mic1>Lvl 23<td class=mic2>+5<td class=mic3>425,000 gp<tr><td class=mic1>Lvl 13<td class=mic2>+3<td class=mic3>17,000 gp<td class=mic4> <td class=mic1>Lvl 28<td class=mic2>+6<td class=mic3>2,125,000 gp</table><p class=mistat><b>Neck Slot</b></p><p class=mistat><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> Fortitude, Reflex, and Will</p><h2 class=mihead>Power ✦ Daily (Free Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'>Use this power when an ally within 10 squares of you fails a saving throw.

It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it.

The helm is ingratiating and a little cloying, but it urges the PC toward what it calls “creative destruction”—engaging in rebellion, strange behavior, and violence for its own sake. If the PC resists those urges, the helm says it doesn't mind and apologizes for being so “aggressive.” And if the PC goes along with the helm's suggestions but the end result isn't positive, then the helm apologizes and promises to “be more helpful next time.”<bt>The helm is likewise apologetic about the daily attacks it makes on its owner: “It's just the cost of power, I'm afraid. I try to keep it in check as best I can, and if you can just roll with the punches and let down your defenses a little, it's easier to keep the urges under control.”<bt>Over time, the helm's “suggestions” get more bizarre, dangerous, and chaotic. At first, the helm might suggest starting an argument with a friend “just to be a devil's advocate.” But after a few weeks, it'll suggest that the friend will “almost certainly” survive the fireball its owner casts. A few weeks after that, it's suggesting a “test of true friendship”: Just cut the rope your friend is climbing up, and if he's a true friend, he'll forgive you when he gets to the top of the cliff.</bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>Until the owner dons the helmet, it has no concordance and doesn't communicate or have any power.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d10<tr><td>Owner follows one of the helm's instructions<td>+1<tr><td>Owner hits both enemies and allies with an attack (maximum 1/day)<td>+1<tr><td>Helm's daily attack misses<td>-1<tr><td>Owner wears something else in the head slot<td>-2</table><h2 class=ah2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext><i>“I'm getting better at blocking out most of the crazy things the helm wants me to do, but sometimes you have to take it off the leash a little.”</i><bt>To reach the concordance level, the owner must be acting on some of the helm's urges and proactively testing himself and his allies by taking (and dealing out) damage in combat.

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.</p><br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 181.</p>","item3351":"<h1 class=mihead>Shinaelestra Chalice of Fellowship<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 9 Common</span></h1><p class=miflavor>You make a toast with this chalice to honor heroism and friendship, bolstering those who share the toast.</p><p class=mistat><b>Wondrous Item</b>        4,200 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Utility Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'><i>Effect:</i> You raise the chalice in a toast, and each ally within 10 squares of you can speak fair words of his or her companions' deeds.

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest.

They extended the acrobatic training, teamwork, and entertainer's panache that they learned from the sideshows to their adventuring career. Everything else about this duo's life is a matter of conjecture, legend, and tall tale. To this day, no one is sure of their gender or race, where they were born, or the details of their adventuring career.

Even limited as they are, the artifacts' communications advance their goal of bringing more daring action and excitement into the world.<bt>Rash and Reckless share a friendly sense of competition. Each pair of boots seeks to goad its owner into the greatest, most flamboyant and foolhardy deeds. This competitiveness rubs off on the owners of the items, leading to characters who constantly seek to outdo each other in performing outrageous stunts. The artifacts reward this type of behavior with increased concordance.</bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>Each pair of boots has its own concordance with its owner.

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions.

Possession of the entire Crown is appropriate for characters in the middle of the heroic tier and upward.<bt>In its sundered form, the Ashen Crown consists of a magic circlet to which the other magic items are attached. A byeshk blade, magically shapeable, is the Crown's front ornament. Two gems—one a magic solitaire, the other a small orb—are set to either side. A braided cord of mithral and gold wraps tightly around the Crown's circlet. Arkantaash was sundered shortly before the fall of Dhakaan. Legendary goblin heroes wielded the pieces, and each part now bears the name of its last wielder.

It persists within the collection of magic items known as the Returning Beast. <br>    Each item is composed of a portion of the beast's body. To make good on its return, it must find and reunite those hidden pieces of its carcass. As its strength grows, it will feed its hunger for vengeance against the Black Call by tracking its members down one by one and destroying them without mercy.<br>    The item set is a collection of six paragon tier magic items: bands of equilibrium, eye of prophecy, razortail, ring of the deep wood, blade of the stalking predator, and totem of the dancing leaf. These items house the remaining essence of the Beast of Talgora. As pieces are brought together, a primal intelligence becomes apparent to the items' wielders. If all of the items are reunited, the Beast of Talgora's spirit will try to force its way back into the world with the help of whoever possesses the items, whether or not those possessors are willing agents.<br>    The Beast of Talgora's spirit cannot control the items that house it or those that wield them, but its powerful presence is always felt. It doesn't speak, but its intense emotions and broken, violent thoughts bubble constantly through the minds of its wielders. It subtly urges its wielders to push forward, to seek out its remains, and to hunt members of the Black Call.

Sages say that during Dran's metamorphosis into what should have been a green slaad, he instead became something else, a creature that drew power from both chaos and shadow. This new Dran was quickly recruited to the service of the slaad Ygorl, Lord of Entropy, as a sorcerous assassin.     <br>    Few killers have shed more blood across the worlds than Xenda-Dran. The slaad took great pleasure in assassinating powerful enemies, and with each slaying his powers grew stronger. The mightiest denizens of the Elemental Chaos found their existences cut short as they were strangled by their own shadows or saw their own flesh stripped from their bones by discordant energies.<br>    Xenda-Dran began to collect trophies from his greatest kills, and he enchanted them into armaments that made him even more formidable. <br>✦     From the hands of a rival assassin, the babau Timmevinc, the slaad crafted grisly gauntlets that channeled the demon's corrosive power.<br>✦     When Dran defeated a pack of ice devils bent on Ygorl's death in the middle of a deadly storm, he claimed the leader's horn for a special focus.<br>✦     The hides of sixty-six different elemental denizens were sewn into his cloak, including the skins of slaad warriors, the scales of demons, and the preserved flesh of myriad archons.<br>✦     The djinn lord Abisali-agharr sat in his fortified palace in the clouds, surrounded by mighty elemental warriors. Still, he could not find safety from Xenda-Dran's blades, and his soul was trapped in the assassin's magic ring.<br>✦     Even the most powerful slaads who crossed Dran met grisly fates—Dran's boots were made from the remains of the void-bending black and gray slaads, reminding his fellows that he found them fit only for treading on.<br><br>The legends are unclear on how Xenda-Dran met his end. Some say his final adversary was none other than the enlightened githzerai master, Liricosa. Most believe that Dran was destroyed in their confrontation, but some monks claim that Liricosa's transcendent wisdom taught even a slaad the way of order. They believe that Xenda-Dran transformed one final time, into one of Liricosa's pupils.<br>    Whatever truly happened, Xenda-Dran's armaments were scattered throughout the worlds. From time to time, the items resurface, spreading death and destruction before disappearing again, inspiring legends as well as the crafting of many imitations.</p><h3>Xenda-Dran's Array Items</h3><table class=ignore><tr><th class=miset>Lvl</th><th class=miset>Name</th><th class=miset>Price (gp)</th><th class=miset>Item Slot</th><tr><td>10+<td>Babau Gauntlets<td>5000<td>Hands<tr><td>11+<td>Ring of the Djinn Slayer<td>9000<td>Ring<tr><td>8+<td>Hailstorm Ki Focus<td>3400<td>Implement<tr><td>8+<td>Rift Dancer Boots<td>3400<td>Feet<tr><td>9+<td>Elemental Ward Cloak<td>4200<td>Neck</table><h3>Xenda-Dran's Array Benefits</h3><table class=ignore><tr><th class=miset>Pieces</th><th class=miset>Benefit</th><tr><td>2<td>At the end of each extended rest, choose acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning.

When you command the balancer, you and the balancer share knowledge but not senses.<br>    When you take a move action, you can also command the balancer to move up to its speed.<br>    When the balancer makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br>    The balancer lasts until you use this power again, until it drops below 1 hit point, or until it ends its turn more than 10 squares away from the modron toy. If the balancer drops below 1 hit point, you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left).

The combined group was the idea of its leader Trebarra Kan, a powerful priest who, by adeptly leading a double life, managed to become ordained by the temples of both deities. The revelation of his twin loyalties drew faithful from both sides, and the pact between them became both powerful and wideranging. Power brought discord, however, and a competition for allegiances followed. As his careful plans began unraveling, Trebarra Kan attempted to create a magic mirror that would bend insurgents to his will and drive others mad.

At first, it provides nothing but benefits to its owner. Once the crown has worked its way into the mind of its host and made the host dependent on its abilities, the crown begins nudging its owner toward the citystate of Eldaarich. This drive manifests in the form of enticement (offering greater rewards for doing as the crown wants) and punishment (denying something essential to the owner until the Crown of Whispers gets what it wants).<bt>The primary way the crown communicates with its owner is through a chorus of whispering voices that only the wearer can hear. When the crown is first placed upon the wearer's head, these whispers are muted, manifesting only as the brief sound of a wind blowing across a sand dune. As time passes, the crown grows bolder and more skilled at communication with its current wearer, and the whispers grow louder and clearer. After a prolonged period of use by one wearer, the whispers manifested by the artifact form a synchronous chorus that acts as an invisible advisor to that individual, as if a vizier stood just at the shoulder of the wearer.</bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Goals of the Crown</h2><p class=mitext>The Crown of Whispers is a part of Daskinor's own mind, but it was separated and given its independence long ago. Independence means nothing to the crown, though. Instead, it craves the relationship it once had with its first owner. As a result, the Crown of Whispers is possessed of a singular purpose: to become inexorably intertwined with the psyche of Daskinor once more.<bt>Though the crown was formed with the aid of the mind of the sorcerer-king of Eldaarich, only will drives it, not true intelligence. The crown acts using manipulation tactics that its original owner used to great effect and does not possess any logical, reasoning sentience to form new tactics of its own. As it gains familiarity with its current wearer, its knowledge of the wearer's thoughts allows it to prey upon the wearer's fears and more effectively manipulate its current owner. Its goals are as follows.</bt></p><ul class=mitext><li>To return to Eldaarich and rest upon the brow of the mad king Daskinor.</li><li>To be worn by individuals whom it can manipulate into moving it closer to its destination.</li><li>To protect itself from dangers, both real and imaginary, by making its owners as “vigilant” as Daskinor.</li></ul><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>The concordance of the Crown of Whispers represents how well the crown believes that the owner is serving it in leading it back to Eldaarich and Daskinor. As the owner brings the crown closer to its goal, the artifact grows more pleased. Such pleasure is expressed not only by further reward, but also by the growing activity of the crown in the mind of its host. As the concordance increases, so too does the clarity of the whispers in the mind of the host. The crown begins offering advice that sounds like wisdom but slowly turns the wearer more paranoid. Any attempt to thwart the crown's goals displeases it, and its whispers in the mind of its host crescendo into a maddening cacophony.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d10<tr><td>Owner has training in Perception<td>+2<tr><td>Owner has been to Eldaarich<td>+2<tr><td>Owner kills an agent of a sorcerer-king other than Daskinor (maximum 1/encounter)<td>+1<tr><td>Owner spies on an ally (maximum 1/day)<td>+1<tr><td>Owner preemptively attacks an ally<td>+1<tr><td>Owner attempts to remove the crown<td>–2<tr><td>Owner performs a significant act for an ally that builds trust between them<td>–2</table><br><h2 class=ah2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext><i>“I am the Crown of Whispers.

The angered crown refuses to let its owner sleep or meditate, attempting to exhaust the wearer so the dangers of Athas can end the host's ownership of the artifact.<bt>While the crown remains at this concordance, the wearer loses access to the item's domination immunity property, and the crown gains the following properties.</bt></p><br><h2 class=mihead>Properties</h2><ul class=mistat><li>When you take an extended rest, you regain only one healing surge.</li><li>You take a –2 penalty to all defenses.</li></ul><br><h2 class=ah2>Moving On</h2><p class=mitext><i>“Get this thing off me!”</i></p><p class=mitext>The Crown of Whispers constantly wants to move closer to Eldaarich and, by extension, Daskinor. When its owner is taking it farther away from that city-state, the artifact might decide to move on. When it does so, the crown tries to get the host killed. Although the simplest solution might be to get the owner to remove it and pass off the artifact to someone else, the inherent madness of Daskinor within the crown prefers vengeance and death. Furthermore, previous owners of the crown could potentially warn future owners away from donning the artifact, and it wants to make sure that future owners are as susceptible as possible to its manipulation.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 413.</p>","item983":"<h1 class=mihead>Crown of Stuttered Time<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 28 Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This copper crown is set with numerous tiger's-eye gems that slip out of phase with the world even as you do.</p><p class=mistat><b>Head Slot</b>        2,125,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Property</h2><p class=mistat>You gain a +2 item bonus to Will.<br></p><h2 class=mihead>Power (Psychic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'>Until the end of your next turn, you become insubstantial and gain phasing.</p><p class='mistat indent1'><i>Sustain Minor:</i> The effect persists, and you take 10 psychic damage that can't be reduced or prevented in any way.</p><br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault 2, page(s) 128.</p>","item1643":"<h1 class=mihead>Ioun Stone of True Sight<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 28 Rare</span></h1><p class=miflavor>This dark blue rhomboid stone floats lightly in the air, granting you darkvision and greatly enhanced insight and perception.</p><p class=mistat><b>Head Slot</b>        2,125,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Property</h2><p class=mistat>You gain darkvision and a +6 item bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br></p><h2 class=mihead>Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'>Until the end of your next turn, you can clearly see creatures and objects within your line of sight, even if they are invisible or obscured.Sustain Minor: The effect persists until the end of your next turn.</p><br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 249, Dungeon Master's Kit, page(s) 266.</p>","item403":"<h1 class=miset>Golden Lion's Battle Regalia<span class=milevel>Heroic Tier</span></h1><p>A legendary barbarian chieftain of the great deserts, the Golden Lion of Summer was a warrior renowned for her single-minded ferocity and military cunning.

The magic gems he created were the wonder of the realm, and with each one he made, his skill and confidence grew. One day the dwarves of a neighboring realm unearthed a striking gemstone of perfect orange corundum—a blazing sapphire the color of fire. Immeral acquired the great gemstone from the dwarves in exchange for lavish gifts of his earlier work and promises of more to come, and then set about the task of creating his masterwork. Utterly devoted to his queen, he crafted a piece for her that would capture and reflect her beauty forever, which he dubbed the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty.</p><p class=mitext>    When the eladrin queen donned Immeral's jewel, all who stood before her fell under the influence of her beauty. Her realm flourished for many years, and she was famed far and wide for the aid and comfort that she provided for her subjects through the power of the artifact. Yet finally the long golden afternoon of her realm faded into dusk; her enemies grew strong, and the untold value of the jewel incited avarice in the hearts of the wicked. One dark day the queen was murdered by her husband, who was half-mad with jealousy because of the love so many nobles and courtiers held for his queen. The prince-consort was put to death, but the deed was done. The jacinth was sequestered away in the royal vaults, only to disappear when evil forces sacked the kingdom a few years later. As for Immeral, he never made another jewel after the jacinth.</p><p class=mitext>    Since the days of the ancient eladrin kingdoms, the jacinth has appeared now and again in the possession of a series of monarchs. It is associated with gracefulness, justice, and prosperity... but also with vanity and avarice. Any monarch in the world would be strengthened by mere possession of the jacinth, and yet all too often the owners who have come after the queen have become obsessed with continuing to add to their own splendor, seeking to gain ever more objects of art and other items treasured for their beauty. Scholars speculate that the jacinth began planting this objective in the minds of its owners after leaving the queen's care. It prompts this greedy behavior in them precisely for the reason of making them vulnerable to others who envy their exquisite treasures. In such a way do these items of utmost value change hands from time to time, perhaps destined to land ultimately in the possession of a great ruler whose appreciation of their beauty knows no bounds, and whose ability to hold onto them despite threats is just as great. So it is with the jacinth itself, which is said to gravitate from owner to owner in a search for one who can truly replace the queen.</p><br><h2 class=artifactHeading1>Goals of the Jacinth</h2><ul class=mitext><li>Be treasured and worn by the most beautiful, graceful, and noble owner; urge an owner lacking in these traits to improve himself or herself.</li><li>Reign in splendor and magnificence, adored by all.</li><li>Celebrate and protect works of art and those who create and cherish them.</li></ul><h2 class=artifactHeading1>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d6<tr><td>Owner gains rank, title, or nobility<td>+1d4<tr><td>Owner has a Charisma score of 16 or higher<td>+2<tr><td>Owner does not wear the Jacinth for a month<td>-1<tr><td>Owner has a Charisma score of 10 or lower<td>-4</table><br><h2 class=artifactHeading2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext>The jacinth is enchanted with the personal majesty of its owner, and gladly reflects and magnifies its owner's glory for all to see.</p><br><p class=mitext>The jacinth's enhancement bonus becomes +5, and its owner gains the use of the item's attack power for as long as the jacinth remains at this concordance.</p><br><h2 class=mihead>➶ Attack Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'><i>Attack:</i> Ranged 5 (one creature in range); your level + 5 vs. Will.</p><p class='mistat indent'><i>Hit:</i> The target is dominated (save ends).

The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions.

The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it.

Later, most rejected the theory because the frog never appeared in any of Kent's other works. The frog then remained a mystery until an adventuring group located the Profound's tomb and recovered the frog, learning of its unusual magical properties.<br><br>Since the emerald frog's rediscovery, many artificers and alchemists have sought to reproduce its curious magic to create new figurines modeled after the first. These copies are worthwhile, but none of them come close to matching the original's power.

The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it.

But it contains the promise of power: defeat the ghostly chessmaster bound to the board, and fantastic rewards are yours for the claiming.<bt>As the owner of the chessboard, you play one exchange of moves per day against the chessmaster. If you win, the chessboard rewards you richly before departing, never to return. If you lose, you'll have to deal with the curse attached to the artifact.<bt>The Immortal Game is appropriate for a character in the early paragon tier and upward.</bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Goals of the Immortal Game</h2><ul class=mitext><li>Test every aspect of each owner.</li><li>Reward the worthy, and punish the unworthy.</li></ul><h2 class=ah1>Roleplaying the Immortal Game</h2><p class=mitext>The Immortal Game appears to be a finely wrought chessboard when first discovered. But if someone sits down at the board and sets up the pieces to begin a game, the spectral chessmaster appears. If the PC sits with the white pieces, then the chessmaster beckons the PC to make the first move. Otherwise the chessmaster points toward the board, and one of the central pawns slides forward.<bt>The game is played with one exchange of moves per day. Whenever the owner wants to play, he need only set out the pieces as they were on the previous day and the chessmaster will appear. After the exchange of moves, the chessmaster disappears, and the board can be put away until the next day.</bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>How to Play the Game</h2><p class=mitext>Those who try their hand at the Immortal Game quickly learn that it's more than just a chess match. As the game progresses, the player starts to ignore his surroundings while playing, and eventually he'll be impossible to rouse from a catatonic state while the moves are being played. The Immortal Game is played on many levels, some of which the player is only subconsciously aware of.<bt>Each day, the player makes an ability score check. Success means a strong move, and failure means a weaker move. The first move is always an Intelligence check. After that point, randomly determine with a d6 which check you use for each day's exchange of moves.<bt><b>Intelligence Check (1–2):</b> The board position is unclear, and you have to work through several positional nuances. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 10 minutes.<bt><b>Charisma Check (3–4):</b> The chessmaster glowers at you, pitting the force of its personality against you as it dares you to make or avoid a specific move. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 10 minutes.<bt><b>Constitution Check (5–6):</b> The board seems to be sapping your energy the longer you stare at it. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 1 hour.</bt></bt></bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>The Chessmaster</h2><p class=mitext>The chessmaster is an intangible manifestation of the artifact itself, and it can't be hurt. It ignores everything except for the game in front of it. It doesn't speak, but it occasionally slumps its shoulders, nods, or otherwise uses body language after a particularly good or bad move.<bt>If anyone tries to take a chess piece more than 5 squares away from the chessboard, the spectral chessmaster appears, transforms into a dread wraith (found on page 267 of the Monster Manual), and vigorously shakes his head. The following round he attacks the bearer of the chess piece if it's not back with the chessboard. Defeating the dread wraith means the chessmaster appears and turns into a dread wraith all over again.<bt>If anyone upsets the chessboard while the owner is playing, the chessmaster likewise turns into a dread wraith and attacks. And if the concordance score is 12 or higher, the PC playing the game is immediately dominated and attacks anyone disrupting the game until all the pieces are put back in place.</bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>Until a chess game starts, the artifact has no concordance and the owner gains only the ritual property.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d4<tr><td>Succeed at an ability score check<td>+1<tr><td>Fail at an ability score check<td>-1</table><h2 class=ah2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext><i>[Mumbles.] “Pin the rook…then knight to h3…”</i><bt>At this point, the player has an overwhelming advantage and is working through various endgame scenarios.

If the DM determines other small penalties that punish tactical failure, he or she can substitute that instead.</p><br><h2 class=ah1>DM Advice</h2><p class=mitext>When you introduce the Immortal Game into your campaign, realize what you're in for: The player will probably play the game for a month or two of game time, and then receive a reward or a big curse.<bt>Ordinarily, the chessboard disappears after the match, but if someone else at your table is keen to try it out (and the first game was good for your campaign), it's OK to have the chessmaster end the game by picking up the board and laying at another PC's feet.<bt>And if you really want to mix it up, you can actually play chess with one of your players, rather than relying on the ability score checks. If you aren't a proficient chess player (or if you're too good), you can use a computer chess application, set to whatever difficulty level seems appropriate to you. But maintain the “one exchange of moves a day” rule, because it's important that the game unfold gradually—and preferably while the PCs are undertaking traditional adventures.</bt></bt></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 368.</p>","item3349":"<h1 class=mihead>Hill Tamer Crook<span class=milevel id=headerlevel>Level 23 Uncommon</span></h1><p class=miflavor>The path over the hill is much easier to negotiate when the hill obliges.</p><p class=mistat><b>Wondrous Item</b>        425,000 gp</p><h2 class=mihead>Utility Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'><i>Effect:</i> You touch the crook against a hill, and the hill bows down submissively, losing its slopes and becoming flat land until you pass by.

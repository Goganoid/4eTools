Each category of armor is either light armor or heavy armor.<br><br>Light Armor<br>Light armor is easy to act in if the wearer has proficiency with it. Cloth armor, leather armor, and hide armor are light armor. While wearing light armor, an adventurer adds either his or her Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, whichever is higher.<br>    ✦     Cloth Armor: Jackets, mantles, woven robes, and padded vests don't provide any significant protection by themselves. However, they can be imbued with protective magic. All adventurers have proficiency with cloth armor.<br>    ✦     Leather Armor: Leather armor is sturdier than cloth armor. It protects vital areas with multiple layers of boiled-leather plates, while covering the limbs with supple leather that provides a small amount of protection.<br>    ✦     Hide Armor: Thicker and heavier than leather, hide armor is composed of skin from any creature that has a tough hide, such as a bear, a griffon, or a dragon. Hide armor can bind and slightly hinder precision, but it's light enough that it doesn't affect an adventurer's speed.<br><br>Heavy Armor<br>Heavy armor is more restrictive than light armor, so natural agility matters less when wearing it. Chainmail, scale armor, and plate armor are heavy armor. An adventurer wearing heavy armor doesn't add an ability score modifier to his or her AC, unless directed to do so by a special effect. In addition, a typical suit of heavy armor imposes a penalty on its wearer's speed, as noted in the armor's description.<br>    ✦     Chainmail: Metal rings woven together into a shirt, leggings, and a hood make up a suit of chainmail. Chainmail grants good protection, but it's cumbersome, so it reduces mobility and agility.<br>    ✦     Scale Armor: Overlapping pieces of highly durable material, such as steel or even dragon scales, make up scale armor. Despite its heaviness, scale is easy to wear; its straps and buckles make it adjustable and able to be fit snugly to the body, allowing flexibility and agility.<br>    ✦     Plate Armor: The heaviest type of armor, made up of shaped plates of metal or similarly resilient material, plate provides the most armor protection. The cost for its superior fortification is mobility and agility.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 266.</p>","glossary640":"<h1 class=player>Automatic Hits</h1><p class=flavor>Some attacks are so lucky or well timed that bonuses, penalties, and other factors don't matter.

The following rules govern both kinds of immediate action.<br><br>Trigger: Each immediate action—usually a power—defines its trigger. The one type of immediate action that every creature can take is a readied action (see “Ready an Action”.<br><br>Someone Else's Turn: A creature cannot take an immediate action on its own turn. The action interrupts some event on another creature's turn or responds to that event.<br><br>Once per Round: A creature can take only one immediate action per round, either an immediate interrupt or an immediate reaction. Therefore, if a creature takes an immediate action, it can't take another one until the start of its next turn.<br><br>Interrupts: An immediate interrupt jumps in when its trigger occurs, taking place before the trigger finishes. If an interrupt invalidates a triggering action, the triggering action is lost.<br>    Example: An enemy makes a melee attack against Keira the rogue, but Keira uses a power that lets her shift away as an immediate interrupt. If the enemy can no longer reach her, its attack action is lost. Similarly, Albanon the wizard might use shield in response to being hit and turn that hit into a miss, or Keira might use the immediate interrupt heroic escape to evade an enemy's attack before it can deal damage.<br><br>Reactions: An immediate reaction lets a creature act in response to a trigger. The triggering action or event occurs and is completely resolved before the reaction takes place.<br>    An immediate reaction waits for its trigger to finish, not necessarily for the action that contains the trigger to finish.<br>    Example: An elder dragon's claw attack power is a standard action that allows two attack rolls against the same target. The dragon faces Fargrim the fighter, who has an immediate reaction (veteran gambit) that is triggered by being hit with a melee attack. If the dragon uses claw and hits Fargrim with the first attack roll, he can use veteran gambit in response to that hit. In that case, the immediate reaction waits for that hit to be resolved, but does not wait for the entire power to be resolved.<br><br>Likewise, an immediate reaction can interrupt movement. Here's how: If a creature triggers an immediate reaction while moving (by coming into range, for instance), the reaction can take place before the creature finishes moving, but after it has moved at least 1 square. In other words, an immediate reaction can be in response to a square of movement, rather than to an entire move action.<br><br>If an effect has a trigger but is neither an immediate action nor an opportunity action, assume that it behaves like an immediate reaction, waiting for its trigger to completely resolve. However, ignore this guideline when the effect has to interrupt its trigger to function. For instance, if a triggered power allows an adventurer to use a free action to reroll an attack roll, with the hope of turning a miss into a hit, the power must interrupt the trigger (“You miss with an attack”) to function; otherwise the attack would be resolved as a miss.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 268, Rules Compendium, page(s) 195.</p>","glossary320":"<h1 class=player>Insubstantial</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature is insubstantial, it takes half damage from any damage source, including ongoing damage.

Outside combat, the DM might allow a creature to make a Stealth check against a distracted target, even if the creature doesn't have superior cover or total concealment and isn't outside the target's line of sight. The target might be focused on something in a different direction, allowing the creature to sneak around it.<br>✦        Success: The creature becomes hidden from the target.

From her new position, the goblin does not have line of sight to her, so she can make a Stealth check to become hidden as part of the movement of her acrobatic maneuver. Because she moved more than 2 squares, though, she takes a -5 penalty to her Stealth check. She rolls a 12, adds her Stealth check modifier (+9) and subtracts the penalty for movement for a result of 16. Her check result is higher than the goblin's passive Perception of 13, so she is hidden from it. The goblin moves during its turn, but Keira still has partial cover from it even after the goblin's movement, so she remains hidden. During her next turn, Keira uses a rogue power that allows her to move 2 squares before her attack. She moves 2 squares out into the open to get a clear shot and then shoots the goblin. Because her movement and attack are both part of the action that causes her to be no longer hidden, she retains the benefit of being hidden until after the attack is resolved. She gains combat advantage and deals her Sneak Attack damage to the goblin. Keira can then use her move action to find a new position from which to make a Stealth check to become hidden again.</p><br><h3>IMPROVISING WITH STEALTH</h3>✦        Hide an object in a room (opposed by Perception)<br>✦        Craft a hidden compartment or sheath (moderate DC)<br>✦        Embed a secret message in a letter (opposed by Insight)<br><br>Update (6/19/2012)<br>Updated in Rules Compendium.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 188, Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 222, Martial Power 2, page(s) 57, Rules Compendium, page(s) 152.</p>","glossary220":"<h1 class=player>Unarmed</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature punches, kicks, elbows, or head-butts an opponent, it's making an unarmed strike.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 216, Rules Compendium, page(s) 272.</p>","glossary41":"<h1 class=player>demon</h1><p class=flavor>Demons are chaotic evil elemental creatures native to the Abyss.

You don't memorize or prepare a ritual; a ritual is so long and complex that no one could ever commit the whole thing to memory. To perform a ritual, you need to read from a book or a scroll containing it.<br><br>A ritual book contains one or more rituals that you can use as often and as many times as you like, as long as you can spare the time and the components to perform the ritual.<br><br>A ritual scroll contains a single ritual, and you can perform the ritual from that scroll only once. After that, the magic contained in the scroll is expended, and the scroll turns to dust. Anyone can use a ritual scroll to perform the ritual it contains, as long as the appropriate components are expended.<br><br>Owning a ritual book isn't enough to let you perform the ritual or rituals in it. You must first master a ritual by studying it for 8 uninterrupted hours. (If you gained a ritual by creating its book yourself or by obtaining it as a class feature, you have already mastered it.)<br><br>You must meet two requirements to master a ritual. You must have the Ritual Caster feat, and your level must equal or exceed the ritual's level. If you meet those requirements and spend 8 hours studying a ritual, you can add it to your list of mastered rituals. As long as you have the ritual's book handy, you can perform a mastered ritual whenever you want. <br><br>There's no limit to the number of rituals you can master.<br><br>Performing a Ritual: To perform a ritual that you have mastered, you spend a certain amount of time (specified in the ritual description) performing various actions appropriate to the ritual. The actions might include reading long passages out of the ritual book, scribing complex diagrams on the ground, burning special incense or sprinkling mystic reagents at appropriate times, or performing a long set of meticulous gestures. The specific activities required aren't described in most ritual descriptions; they're left to your imagination.<br>A ritual requires certain esoteric components, which you purchase before you perform the ritual and which are expended when the ritual is complete. Each ritual specifies the cost of the components you need. If a ritual requires a skill check, the check usually determines the ritual's effectiveness. Even if the check result is low, a ritual usually succeeds, but if the result is high, you can usually achieve better effects.<br><br>Assisting in a Ritual: Unless a ritual specifies otherwise, up to four of your allies can help you perform a ritual. Everyone assisting you must be within 5 squares of you, and each assistant must actively participate in the ritual for the entire time required to complete it. Your assistants need neither the Ritual Caster feat nor knowledge of the specific ritual. Your allies can assist you in two ways. <br>First, if the ritual requires spending healing surges or some other resource, willing allies can contribute those resources. (Certain rituals might allow unwilling participants to pay those costs as well, but such rituals involve sacrifices to malevolent gods or demon lords and are not found in the ritual books of most player characters.) <br>Second, your allies can assist with the skill check you make to complete a ritual, using the normal rules for cooperating on another character's skill check.<br><br>Interrupting a Ritual: At any time before a ritual is completed, you can stop it and suffer no ill effect. You don't expend any components or pay any costs until a ritual is completed. You can't resume a ritual that was interrupted, however, so you do lose the time you spent on an interrupted ritual.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 296.</p>","glossary110":"<h1 class=player>Turn</h1><p class=flavor>On a creature's turn, it takes actions: a standard action, a move action, a minor action, and any number of free actions, in any order it wishes.

This character must meet the conditions described under the vehicle's driver or pilot entry. A vehicle with no controller goes out of control, typically continuing on its course and crashing into the first obstacle it encounters or else grinding to a halt. <br>    Only one character can control a vehicle during a round, though any number of characters can attempt to take control until one is successful. A character can yield control of a vehicle to another character as a free action, but the character assuming control of the vehicle (a free action) can take no other action with the vehicle during that turn. If a character does not move into the driver or pilot position and assume control when control is yielded to him or her, then the vehicle might go out of control. If no character has taken control of the vehicle by the end of the yielder's next turn, then the vehicle acts at the end of the initiative order according to its out-of-control rules. <br>    A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures occupying it. Creatures moving within a vehicle still provoke opportunity attacks from other creatures in the same vehicle, as normal.<br><br>CONDITIONS<br>Vehicles can be attacked just like other objects. Some conditions (such as being knocked prone) have special rules when applied to a vehicle. Any conditions from the Player's Handbook excluded from this section have no effect on vehicles. If an effect allows a saving throw to end a condition, a vehicle makes one at the end of its controller's turn (or at the end of the vehicle's turn if it is out of control.) A driver or pilot can use a move action to allow a vehicle to make an additional saving throw during his or her turn.<br>✦    Immobilized: An immobilized vehicle cannot move except by a pull, a push, or a slide effect.<br>✦    Prone: A vehicle subject to an effect that would knock it prone instead takes 1d10 damage and is slowed (see below) until the end of the next round.<br>✦    Restrained: A vehicle that is restrained is immobilized and cannot be forced to move by a pull, a push, or a slide effect. If the restrained condition is ended by the escape action, the vehicle uses the driver's or pilot's relevant skill modifier.<br>✦    Slowed: A slowed vehicle uses the standard rules for this condition.<br><br>OUT OF CONTROL<br>Creatures can move, change direction, and come to a stop whenever they choose. Vehicles don't have that luxury. When a vehicle starts moving, it requires effort to keep it moving and on course. Otherwise, it goes out of control.<br>    A driver or pilot must use specific actions to steer, move, or stop a vehicle if he or she doesn't want the vehicle to go out of control. In any round in which no character uses actions to control it, a vehicle acts according to the “Out of Control” section of its statistics block. Some out-of-control vehicles—most commonly those pulled by creatures—come to a stop automatically. Some vehicles, such as ships, continue to move ahead until they collide with something. Other vehicles—especially flying crafts—can crash quickly.<br><br>CRASHING AND RAMMING<br>Though most vehicles are meant for long-distance transportation, some are designed for combat. If a vehicle tries to move into a space occupied by an object, a creature, or another vehicle, it crashes. The vehicle, any creatures pulling it, and whatever it hits take 1d10 damage per square the vehicle moved in its previous turn. Creatures on board the vehicle (and those on the vehicle or object it hits) take half damage.<br>    If the target of the crash is more than one size category smaller than the out-of-control vehicle, the vehicle continues to move regardless of how much damage it dealt during the crash. The space that the target occupies is treated as difficult terrain for the vehicle's movement.<br>    Against targets of equal or greater size, the vehicle continues to move only if the target is destroyed. If the target is not destroyed, the vehicle's move ends immediately.<br><br>TURNING AND HEADING<br>Creatures on a battle grid can change direction at any point during movement. The rules do not make a distinction between a creature's front, back, and sides because it is assumed that a creature can turn around in its space. However, you cannot simply turn a speeding vehicle in the opposite direction, and thus vehicle combat is more complicated.<br>    Every vehicle has a heading—the direction in which it currently moves. To track a vehicle's heading, place a coin or similar marker along the front edge of the vehicle's space on the battle grid. When a vehicle moves, use the small marker to count off squares in the direction the vehicle is moving. Then move the larger vehicle counter or miniature to catch up.<br><br>DRIVE<br>Vehicles are designed to move in one direction only. You direct a vehicle forward, pushing it ahead. However, vehicles typically lack the maneuverability of a walking creature, and turning them can be slow and difficult. <br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle a distance up to its speed.<br>✦    Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment). It cannot move in other directions without making a turn.<br>✦    Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it.<br>✦    Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures. In the case of a creature-drawn vehicle, the creature pulling or pushing the vehicle makes the appropriate check(s). For vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain.<br><br>TURN<br>You turn a vehicle to speed around corners, avoid obstacles, or make a sudden change in its current heading.<br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle a distance equal to half its speed.<br>✦    Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment).<br>✦    Heading Marker: At any point during the vehicle's movement, move its heading marker from its current position to either side of the vehicle (a 90-degree turn). Reorient the vehicle's counter or miniature accordingly at the end of the move.<br>✦    Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it.<br>✦    Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures.

In the case of vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain.<br><br>STOP<br>When a vehicle is moving, it takes effort to stop it.<br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle forward a number of squares equal to the distance it moved in the previous round. At the end of the move, the vehicle is motionless. A vehicle begins moving again when its driver or pilot uses the drive action. A stopped vehicle does not go out of control while motionless unless otherwise noted in its description.<br>✦    Direction: The vehicle's heading marker remains in place.

Readying an action is a way of saying, “As soon as x happens, my character does y.” Examples include “As soon as the troll walks out from behind the corner, I shoot an arrow at it,” or “If the goblin ends its movement adjacent to me, I shift away.”<br><br>Ready an Action<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action. To ready an action, a creature follows these steps.<br>        1. Choose Action to Ready: Choose the specific action the creature is readying (the attack it plans to use, for example), as well as the intended target, if applicable. The creature can ready a standard action, a move action, or a minor action. Whichever action is chosen, the act of readying it is a standard action.<br>        2. Choose Trigger: Choose the circumstance that will trigger the readied action. When that trigger occurs, the creature can use the readied action. If the trigger doesn't occur or the creature chooses to ignore it, the creature can't use the readied action and instead takes its next turn as normal.<br>        3. Immediate Reaction: Using a readied action is an immediate reaction, so it takes place right after the trigger finishes.<br>        4. Reset Initiative: When the creature finishes the readied action, its place in the initiative order moves to directly before the creature or the event that triggered the readied action.<br><br>Triggering Opportunity Actions<br>If a creature readies an action that normally triggers opportunity actions, it triggers them twice: when it readies the action and when it takes the action.<br>    Example: If an adventurer readies a ranged attack while adjacent to an enemy, he provokes an opportunity attack from that enemy. If he is still adjacent to an enemy when he makes the ranged attack, he provokes an opportunity attack again.<br><br>Interrupting with a Readied Action<br>Often a player wants his or her character to use a readied action to attack before an enemy does. In this situation, the action should be readied to respond to the enemy's movement. That way, if the enemy moves before attacking, the readied action will be triggered by a portion of that movement, allowing the character to interrupt it and attack first. Readying an action to be triggered by an enemy attack means that the readied action will occur as a reaction to the attack, so the character's attack happens only after the enemy attacks.<br>    An enemy might use a power that lets it move and then attack with a single action. If a character readied an action to attack in response to that enemy's movement, the readied action interrupts the movement, allowing the character to attack before the enemy does.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 291, Rules Compendium, page(s) 247.</p>","glossary432":"<h1 class=player>Silvered Weapons</h1><p class=flavor>Some monsters, such as werewolves, are susceptible to attacks made by silvered weapons.

They also have defenses: AC, Fortitude, and Reflex. Objects don't have Will, however (see “Object Immunities,” below).<br><br>Determining Defenses: An object's AC, Fortitude, and Reflex depend entirely on its size, as noted in the Object Properties table. These defenses are typically very low, so it's pretty easy to hit an object—so easy, in fact, that many DMs skip the attack roll against an object unless the situation is particularly dramatic.<br><br>Determining Hit Points: An object's hit point total generally depends on two factors: the object's size and its material. As a rule, larger or thicker objects have more hit points than smaller or thinner ones. Objects made of stone or metal have more hit points than those made of wood or glass.<br>    Exceptions to this general rule abound. An object that's big but full of delicate moving parts might have fewer hit points than a smaller, more solid object, because it doesn't take as much damage to render the complex object functionally useless. <br>    To determine an object's hit points, first find its size on the Object Properties table. Then consult the Object Hit Point Multipliers table and apply the appropriate multipliers based on the object's material, composition, or both. If more than one multiplier is appropriate, the order doesn't matter. A Large iron clockwork contraption, for instance, should have around 60 hit points (40 for Large, × 3 for iron, × 0.5 for intricate construction).<br>    An object reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed or otherwise rendered useless. At the DM's discretion, the object might remain more or less whole, but its functionality is ruined—a door knocked from its hinges or a clockwork mechanism broken internally, for instance.<br>    Even though an object has hit points, it is never considered to be bloodied. The DM can certainly describe when the object has less than half of its hit points remaining (“The door is barely holding together now,” for instance), but effects that are triggered by a target being bloodied are not triggered by an object.<br><br>Object Properties<br></p><table><tr><th>Size</th><th>AC/Reflex</th><th>Fortitude</th><th>Base HP</th><th>Examples</th><tr><td>Tiny<td>10<td>5<td>5<td>Bottle, book<tr><td>Small<td>8<td>8<td>10<td>Treasure chest, manacles<tr><td>Medium<td>5<td>10<td>20<td>Door, statue<tr><td>Large<td>4<td>12<td>40<td>Wagon, vault door<tr><td>Huge<td>3<td>15<td>100<td>Big statue<tr><td>Gargantuan<td>2<td>20<td>200<td>Even bigger statue</table><br><br>Object Hit Point Multipliers<br><table><tr><th>Multiplier</th><th>Material/Composition</th><tr><td>x0.25<td>Very fragile<tr><td>x0.5<td>Fragile or intricate<tr><td>x1.5<td>Reinforced<tr><td>x0.1<td>Paper or cloth<tr><td>x0.25<td>Glass or ice<tr><td>x0.5<td>Leather or hide<tr><td>x1<td>Wood<tr><td>x2<td>Stone<tr><td>x3<td>Iron or steel<tr><td>x5<td>Adamantine</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 176.</p>","glossary154":"<h1 class=player>Push</h1><p class=flavor>When you push a creature, each square you move it must place it farther away from you.<br><br>•     Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on the same horizontal plane.

The transmission and effects of a disease follow three steps: exposure, infection, and progression.<br><br>1. Exposure<br>A creature that is exposed to a disease risks contracting it. A creature is typically exposed to a disease in one of two ways:<br>    ✦     Monster Attack: A monster has an attack power that includes a disease (such as filth fever) as one of its effects.<br>    ✦     Environmental Exposure: A phenomenon or environmental feature that a creature touches, ingests, or inhales includes a disease. The phenomenon's description specifies whether exposure to the disease is automatic or requires a successful attack roll against the creature.<br><br>Unless the disease-inducing attack power or environmental description says otherwise, a creature exposed to the disease does not automatically contract it. Instead, the creature makes a saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if the exposure leads to infection. If the saving throw fails, the creature is infected.<br>    If a creature is exposed to the same disease multiple times in an encounter, it makes a single saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if it contracts the disease. For instance, if Uldane is bitten over and over by dire rats carrying the filth fever disease, he makes a single saving throw against that disease at the end of the encounter, not multiple saving throws.<br><br>2. Infection.<br>Each disease has stages of increasing severity. Typically a disease has four stages.<br>    ✦     Stage 0 (the disease ends)<br>    ✦     Stage 1 (usually the initial effect of the disease)<br>    ✦     Stage 2 (a more severe version of stage 1)<br>    ✦     Stage 3 (usually the final stage of the disease)<br><br>The effect that exposes a creature to a disease specifies the stage of the disease that applies when the creature is infected. As soon as the creature contracts the disease, the creature is subjected to that stage's effects. For instance, an attack power might say that a creature contracts filth fever (stage 1), which means the creature has the effects of stage 1 upon infection. If no stage is specified for a disease, the creature starts at stage 1.<br>    Unless the disease is removed from the creature—with a power, a magical ritual, or something else—the disease might progress at the end of the creature's next extended rest.<br><br>3. Progression<br>While infected by a disease, a creature faces the possibility of the disease getting worse. However, the creature also has a chance to rally against it. Adventurers often help one another combat a disease by using the Heal skill on another's behalf.<br><br>Endurance Checks: Until the disease ends, the creature must make an Endurance check at the end of each extended rest to determine if the disease's stage changes or stays the same. A disease typically specifies two DCs. A check result that equals or exceeds the higher DC causes the stage of the disease to decrease by 1 (in other words, the creature's health improves). If the check result equals the lower DC or a number between it and the higher DC, the disease remains at its current stage. A lower check result causes the stage of the disease to increase by 1 (in other words, the creature's health worsens).<br>    Some diseases have more than two DCs, require a skill other than Endurance, or require checks at different times. For instance, a disease might require a creature to make an Endurance check against it at the end of each short rest.<br><br>Reaching a New Stage: When a creature reaches a new stage of the disease, it is subjected to the effects of the new stage right away. Unless a disease description says otherwise, the effects of the new stage replace the effects of the old one.<br><br>Final Stage: When a creature reaches the highest stage of a disease (usually stage 3), it stops making checks against the disease. The creature is now stuck with the disease until cured by a power, a magical ritual, or something else.<br>    A particular disease might specify an unusual way to cure the creature (drink from a particular magic stream, for instance) and another disease might be mild enough that it has no final stage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 184.</p>","glossary136":"<h1 class=player>Dying</h1><p class=flavor>✦     The creature is unconscious.<br>✦     The creature must make death saving throws.<br>✦     This condition ends immediately on the creature when it regains hit points.<br><br>Dropping to 0 hit points or fewer subjects an adventurer to this condition.

(Other effects, such as traps or zones, can also force targets to move.) The three kinds of forced movement are pull, push, and slide. Teleporting a creature does not count as forced movement for the purpose of these rules.<br>    ✦     Pull: Pulling a target means that each square of the forced movement must bring the target closer to the creature or effect that is pulling it.<br>    ✦     Push: Pushing a target means that each square of the forced movement must move the target farther away from the creature or effect that is pushing it.<br>    ✦     Slide: Sliding a target can move it in any direction. Sometimes a creature can swap places with a target. Doing so is a special kind of slide; the creature slides the target into its space and then shifts so that its space includes at least 1 square that the target just left.<br><br>The following rules govern all three kinds of forced movement. A particular instance of forced movement might contain exceptions to these rules.<br><br>Distance, Specific Destination, or Both: The power or other effect that produces forced movement specifies a distance in squares, a specified destination square, or both for the movement.<br>    When a distance is specified, it is a maximum; the creature or effect producing the forced movement can move its target up to that number of squares (or none at all). For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target 4 squares (or “up to 4 squares”); both mean the character can move the target up to 4 squares or not move it at all.<br>    When a destination is specified, it is absolute; the creature or effect must either move the target to that destination or not move it at all. Often a destination is combined with a distance, which means the target can be moved to the destination only if it is no farther away than the specified distance. For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target up to 5 squares to a square adjacent to you (or “5 squares to a square adjacent to you),” both of which mean the character can move the target up to 5 squares but only if the move ends in a square adjacent to that character.<br><br>Line of Effect: A creature must have line of effect to any square that it pulls, pushes, or slides a target into. Also, a target cannot be forced through blocking terrain.<br><br>Ignores Difficult Terrain: Forced movement isn't hindered by difficult terrain.<br><br>Ignores Speed: A target's speed is irrelevant to the distance it is forced to move, and the target expends none of its own actions for the movement.<br><br>Destination Space: The destination of the forced movement must be an unoccupied space that is at least the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be pushed into a space that is only 1 square wide.<br><br>No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target is pulled, pushed, or slid, it does not trigger opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement.<br><br>Catching Oneself: If a target is forced over a precipice or into hindering terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can immediately make a saving throw to avoid going over the edge or entering that terrain. If the creature saves, it falls prone in the last square it occupied before it would have fallen or entered the terrain. Otherwise, it falls over the edge or enters the terrain. Once the saving throw is resolved, the forced movement ends.<br><br>Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on the same horizontal plane. Forced movement can become three-dimensional when the target is flying, is moved through a substance such as water, or is on a non-horizontal surface, such as an incline, that supports it. This means an earthbound target cannot normally be pushed to a square in the air, but a hovering target can be. Similarly, a target can be pulled down a flight of stairs, and it can be slid in any direction underwater.<br><br>Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized doesn't prevent a target from being pulled, pushed, or slid, but being restrained does.

For example, “Augment 1” means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as “Hit” or “Effect,” that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented.

For instance, a mount for a Medium creature must be Large or larger.<br>    • Willing: The creature must be a willing mount. The mount is considered an ally to its rider and the rider's allies.<br><br>Mounting and Dismounting<br>The most common ways for a rider to get on or off a mount are using the mount and dismount actions. Uncommon ways include teleportation and jumping.<br>    Mount (Move Action): The rider mounts a creature adjacent to it and enters its space.<br>    Dismount (Move Action): The rider dismounts, moving from the mount's space to a square adjacent to it.<br><br>Rules for the Mount and Rider<br>A mount and rider follow these rules while the rider is mounted.<br>    Space: The rider and mount both occupy the mount's space and are considered adjacent to each other. However, the origin square of any of the rider's powers and other effects does not change to the mount's size. Whenever the rider uses an effect that has an origin square (such as a melee, a ranged, a close, or an area power), the rider first picks where that square is located in the mount's space, and the effect uses that origin square (the rider still shares the mount's space for the purpose of triggering effects, such as opportunity attacks). For instance, if a Medium rider uses a close burst attack power, the rider chooses a single square within the mount's space, and the burst emanates from that square. This rule means that if the burst targets each creature within it, rather than each enemy, it can hit the mount.<br>    Initiative: The mount and rider act on the rider's initiative count, even if the mount had a different initiative before the rider mounted it. The two continue to act on the same initiative count after the rider dismounts. A monster and its mount have separate turns, whereas an adventurer and his or her mount have a single turn.<br>    Actions (Adventurers Only): An adventurer and his or her mount have a shared set of actions: a standard action, a move action, and a minor action. However, they each have their own free actions. The player chooses how the two creatures divide up the set of actions on the adventurer's turn. Most commonly, the mount takes a move action to walk or shift, and the adventurer takes a standard action to attack. The adventurer and the mount also share a single immediate action each round and a single opportunity action each turn. If one of the creatures can't take actions, the shared set of actions is still available to the other creature. If either creature is dazed, that creature can take only one of the shared actions.<br>    If the adventurer dismounts, the two still share one set of actions on that turn, but have separate sets of actions on subsequent turns.<br>    Mount Attacks: The mount takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls. While not being ridden, a typical mount (such as a riding horse) rarely attacks on its own, unless it has been trained for battle, is defending itself, or feels unusually protective of its rider. Left to its own devices, a typical mount avoids combat.<br>    Charging: When the rider charges, the rider and mount move up to the mount's speed and then the rider makes the charge attack. When the mount charges, it follows the normal rules for a charge.<br>    Squeezing: When the mount squeezes, the rider is also considered to be squeezing.<br>    Targeting the Mount and Rider: Even though the mount and rider occupy the same space, they are still separate creatures and are targeted separately. For instance, an attack that targets only one creature can target either the mount or the rider, not both. In contrast, area and burst attacks can affect both mount and rider, since the two are in the same space.<br>    Provoking Opportunity Attacks: If the mount's movement provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker chooses to target either the mount or the rider, since the two of them move together. However, if the mount or the rider provokes an opportunity attack by using a ranged or an area power, the attacker must target whichever one of them provoked the opportunity attack.<br>    Forced Movement: If the mount is pulled, pushed, or slid, the rider moves with it. If the rider is pulled, pushed, or slid and the mount isn't, the rider can have the two of them move together. Otherwise, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in the destination space of the forced movement.<br>    Teleportation: If either the mount or the rider is teleported, the other does not teleport with it. If the mount is teleported without the rider, the rider is dismounted and falls prone.<br>    Falling Prone: If the mount falls prone, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in an unoccupied space of the rider's choice adjacent to the now-prone mount. However, if the mount is flying when it is knocked prone, it instead falls. The rider isn't dismounted unless the mount lands and falls prone itself. A rider who is knocked prone can immediately make a saving throw. On a roll of 9 or lower, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in an unoccupied space of the rider's choice adjacent to the mount. On a roll of 10 or higher, the rider is neither dismounted nor knocked prone.

Most adventurers have proficiency with simple weapons.<br>    ✦     Military Weapons: This category includes soldierly weapons such as longswords, warhammers, halberds, and longbows. Proficiency with these weapons is not as widespread as proficiency with simple weapons.<br>    ✦     Superior Weapons: This category includes specialized weapons such as rapiers, bastard swords, and shuriken. An adventurer typically gains proficiency with a superior weapon only by taking the Weapon Proficiency feat.<br>    ✦     Improvised Weapons: This category includes anything that was not fashioned as a weapon but that can be used as one. Examples include fists, rocks, chairs, and tankards.<br><br>Weapons in all categories are further defined as either melee or ranged and as either one-handed or two-handed.<br>    ✦     Melee: A melee weapon is used to attack a target within the weapon's reach. Unless otherwise noted, a melee weapon has a reach of 1 square. Melee weapons are used with melee powers and with close powers that have the weapon keyword. A melee weapon cannot be used with a ranged power or an area power that has the weapon keyword, unless the weapon has the light thrown or the heavy thrown property or the weapon is thrown as an improvised ranged weapon.<br>    ✦     Ranged: A ranged weapon is used to fire projectiles at a target within the weapon's range. Alternatively, the weapon is thrown at a target if the weapon has the heavy thrown or the light thrown property. Each ranged weapon has a normal range and a long range measured in squares. Ranged weapons are used with ranged powers and area powers that have the weapon keyword. A ranged weapon cannot be used with a melee power or a close power that has the weapon keyword, unless the weapon is wielded as an improvised melee weapon.<br>    ✦     One-Handed: A one-handed weapon is light enough or balanced enough to wield in one hand. A creature can carry a one-handed weapon in each hand, but doing so does not let the creature make extra attacks in a round. The creature must choose which of the weapons it is wielding when it makes a weapon attack. If a weapon attack power allows the use of two weapons, one of the weapons must have the off-hand property.<br>    ✦     Two-Handed: A two-handed weapon is too heavy or unbalanced to wield without using two hands. Bows and some other weapons require two hands because of their construction. A small creature can't use a two-handed weapon unless the weapon has the small property.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 268.</p>","skill2":"<h1 class=player>ARCANA (INTELLIGENCE)</h1><p><br>The Arcana skill encompasses knowledge about magic-related lore and magical effects. Training in this skill represents academic study, either formalized or as a hobby. This knowledge can touch on any source of magical power—whether arcane, divine, primal, or another one—and extends to information about the following planes of existence, including the creatures native to those planes: the Elemental Chaos, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell. Those that have training in Arcana also have a chance to know something about the mysterious Far Realm, but not about its creatures (such knowledge falls under the Dungeoneering skill). A creature can sometimes use its knowledge of magic to interact with or manipulate magical phenomena.</p><h3>ARCANA KNOWLEDGE</h3>Make an Arcana check to recall a relevant piece of magic-related lore or to recognize a magic-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks”). A creature must have training in Arcana to possess information about the Far Realm.<br><h3>MONSTER KNOWLEDGE</h3>Construct, Elemental, Fey, and Shadow<br>Refer to these rules whenever a character makes a check to identify a mon-ster, regardless of the knowledge skill he or she is using. The DM typically tells a player which skill to use, based on the creature's origin or relevant keyword. If a monster's origin and keyword suggest the use of two different skills, the DM decides which skill can be used to identify the monster, and might allow the use of either skill. For example, a dracolich is both a natu-ral creature and undead, but the DM might decide that its being undead is more relevant than its natural origin and require the use of Religion. In contrast, an abyssal ghoul is an elemental undead creature, and the DM might allow the use of either Arcana or Religion.<br><h3>DETECT MAGIC (Trained only)</h3>Creatures that have training in Arcana can use the skill to identify magical effects and to sense the presence of magic.<br><br>Identify Conjuration or Zone <p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Minor action. The creature must be able to perceive the conjuration or the zone.<br>✦        DC: Moderate DC of the conjuration's or the zone's level.<br>✦        Success: The creature identifies the power used to create the conjuration or the zone and knows the effects and keywords of the conjuration or the zone.<br>✦        Failure: The creature can't try to identify the effect again until after a short rest.</p><br><br>Identify Magical Phenomenon<br>Make an Arcana check to identify a magical phenomenon that was created by a magical ritual or that is part of the environment, such as glowing runes on a cavern wall, an eldritch sign glimmering on an altar, a waterfall that flows upward, or a piece of earth floating in the air. This use of the skill is not normally used to identify powers, magic items, or their effects.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Standard action. The creature must be able to perceive the phenomenon.<br>✦        DC: Hard DC of the phenomenon's level. If it has no level, use the hard DC of the creature's level.<br>✦        Success: The creature identifies the phenomenon's power source and other keywords, if any, as well as the phenomenon's basic purpose if it's not obvious. If a magical ritual created the phenomenon, the creature identifies the ritual and is familiar with its effects.<br>✦        Failure: The creature can't try to identify the phenomenon again until after an extended rest.</p><br><br>Sense the Presence of Magic<br>Make an Arcana check to sense the presence of magic in an area. Typically creatures use the skill in this way when no magic is observable, but they suspect it is present.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Standard action. The creature attempts to detect each source of magical energy within a number of squares equal to 5 + its level, ignoring all barriers.<br>✦        DC: Hard DC of the creature's level. The creature automatically succeeds in detecting any source of magical energy within range that is five or more levels lower than its level.<br>✦        Success: The creature detects each source of magical energy within range and learns its power sources, if any. If a source of magical energy is within line of sight, the creature pinpoints its location. If it's not within line of sight, the creature knows the direction from which the magical energy emanates but does not know how far away it is.<br>✦        Failure: The creature detects nothing, or nothing is within range to detect.

In the game, flying creatures face far fewer limitations.<br>    Flight follows the basic movement rules, with the following clarifications.<br><br>Fly Speed: To fly, a creature takes the walk, run, or charge action but uses its fly speed in place of its walking speed. A creature that has a fly speed can also shift and take other move actions, as appropriate, while flying.<br><br>Moving Up and Down: While flying, a creature can move straight up, straight down, or diagonally up or down.

This means a flying creature falls when it becomes unconscious or is subject to any other effect that knocks it prone. The creature isn't actually prone until it lands and takes falling damage.<br><br>Remaining in the Air: A flying creature does not need to take any particular action to remain aloft; the creature is assumed to be flying as it fights, moves, and takes other actions. However, a flying creature falls the instant it is stunned, unless it can hover (see \"Flight Traits\").<br>Landing: If a creature flies to a surface it can hold onto or rest on, the creature can land safely.<br><br>Terrain: Terrain on the ground does not affect a flying creature if the terrain isn't tall enough to reach it.

Here are some of the most common schools.<br>    ✦     Enchantment: Enchantment powers alter creatures' emotions, thoughts, and actions, including beguiling onlookers, terrifying foes, and encouraging allies.<br>    ✦     Evocation: Evocation powers bring various magical effects into being, including explosions, rays of magical energy, and lingering environmental effects. This is the most widely practiced school of magic. Scholars have various theories about the connection, if any, between this school of magic and primal powers, which are sometimes called evocations. Both evocation powers and primal powers involve calling on magical energy in the cosmos. Evocation powers draw on the very fabric of existence, whereas primal powers call on the spirits found throughout the world.<br>    ✦     Illusion: Illusion powers deceive the mind or the senses, often creating elaborate apparitions. Illusion is also an effect type.<br>    ✦     Transmutation: A transmutation power magically transforms its target in some way, changing the target's form, composition, or both. Damage caused by such a power is usually the result of the trauma brought about by the transformation. Transmutation powers sometimes cause such extensive changes that they are also polymorph powers, but the power might also keep a target's form intact. For instance, a transmutation power that slows a creature by turning its feet to stone is not subjecting the creature to a polymorph effect.

A disease specifies two target Endurance DCs: a lower DC to maintain and a higher DC to improve.<br> Maintain: If the check result beats the lower DC but doesn't beat the higher one, your condition remains the same.<br> Improve: If the check result beats the higher DC, your condition improves—move one step to the left on the disease track.<br> Worsen: If the check result doesn't beat either DC, your condition worsens—move one step to the right on the disease track.<br> Cure: When you reach the left edge of the track, you are cured and stop making Endurance checks.<br> Final State: When you reach the right edge of the track, the final state of the disease takes effect. Once the disease is in its final state, you no longer make Endurance checks to improve. Often, the only way to recover from the final state is through the Cure Disease ritual.<br><br>Heal Skill: An ally can use a Heal check in place of your Endurance check to help you recover from a disease, as described in the Player's Handbook. </p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 49.</p>","glossary329":"<h1 class=player>Grab</h1><p class=flavor>By using the grab power, any creature can try to seize a target bodily and keep it from moving.

Some perils, such as being pushed into a pit, can be avoided with a save, and many effects last until the affected creature saves against them.<br><br>How to Make a Saving Throw<br>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 without adding any modifiers, unless the creature has bonuses or penalties that specifically apply to saving throws. On a roll of 9 or lower, the saving throw fails. A roll of 10 or higher is a successful saving throw, called a save. Because a saving throw is usually an unmodified roll, it gives slightly better than even odds to avoid or shake off an effect.<br><br>When to Make Saving Throws<br>The game rules explain when to make a saving throw immediately to avoid a peril, such as avoiding being pushed into a pit. See “Falling\" for an example.<br>    If a creature is subject to an effect that a save can end, the creature makes a saving throw against that effect at the end of each of its turns. An effect that a save can end includes one of the following notations: “save ends,” “save ends both,” or “save ends all.”<br>    When two effects are followed by the notation “save ends both,” they are treated as a single effect when making saving throws against them. For instance, if a creature is “weakened and slowed (save ends both),” the creature makes a single saving throw against those two conditions whenever the time comes for it to make saving throws. Similarly, effects that are followed by the notation “save ends all” are treated as a single effect when saving throws are made against them. However, if a creature is subject to separate “weakened (save ends)” and “slowed (save ends)” effects, it must save against each separately. When a creature makes saving throws against multiple effects that a save can end, its player chooses the order of the saving throws.<br>    Sometimes a power or other game feature allows a character to make a saving throw immediately against an effect that a save can end. If the character is allowed to make a single saving throw but is subject to multiple effects that a save can end, the player chooses which of those effects to make the saving throw against.<br><br>Identical Effects that a Save Can End<br>If a character is subject to identical effects that a save can end, ignore all but one of those effects. For instance, if the character is dazed (save ends) and then is attacked and again becomes dazed (save ends), ignore the second effect, since it is identical to the first one.<br>    Identical effects never require multiple saving throws. A creature does make separate saving throws against effects that aren't identical, even if they contain the same condition. For instance, “dazed (save ends)” and “dazed and immobilized (save ends both)” are not identical effects, so separate saving throws are made against each of them.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 279, Rules Compendium, page(s) 227.</p>","glossary629":"<h1 class=player>Skills</h1><table><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Key Ability</th><tr><td>Acrobatics<td>Dexterity<tr><td>Arcana<td>Intelligence<tr><td>Athletics<td>Strength<tr><td>Bluff<td>Charisma<tr><td>Diplomacy<td>Charisma<tr><td>Dungeoneering<td>Wisdom<tr><td>Endurance<td>Constitution<tr><td>Heal<td>Wisdom<tr><td>History<td>Intelligence<tr><td>Insight<td>Wisdom<tr><td>Intimidate<td>Charisma<tr><td>Nature<td>Wisdom<tr><td>Perception<td>Wisdom<tr><td>Religion<td>Intelligence<tr><td>Stealth<td>Dexterity<tr><td>Streetwise<td>Charisma<tr><td>Thievery<td>Dexterity</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 125.</p>","glossary569":"<h1 class=player>Vehicles</h1><p class=flavor>Size: Vehicles have a size just like creatures.<br><br>Hit Points: A vehicle's hit points indicate the amount of punishment it can take. A vehicle reduced to 0 hit points or fewer is destroyed, and creatures on board the destroyed vehicle are knocked prone in their current squares. The vehicle's wreckage occupies its space, making it difficult terrain.<br><br>Space: Unlike creatures, which can move around within a space and squeeze into smaller spaces, vehicles occupy all the space within its dimensions. As a result, vehicles cannot squeeze. For example, a wagon takes up a full 2 squares by 3 squares, meaning it can't fit through a narrow chasm that is only 1 square wide. <br>    Vehicles pulled by creatures indicate only the vehicle's space. The creatures pulling it occupy their normal space on the battle grid.<br><br>Defenses: Like all objects, vehicles have an Armor Class, a Fortitude defense, and a Reflex defense. They do not have a Will defense.<br><br>Speed: A vehicle's speed (given in squares) determines how far it travels when a driver or pilot uses a move action. A driver or pilot who uses two move actions can move a vehicle twice its speed. <br>    The speed of a creature-drawn vehicle is determined by the speed of the creature(s) moving it. <br>    For long-distance movement, most creature-drawn vehicles can travel no more than 10 hours in a day. However, sailing ships and magically propelled crafts are not limited in this way and can travel all day and night if properly crewed.<br><br>Load: A vehicle's load is expressed as the number of Medium creatures (both crew and passengers) that can ride within it, plus the amount of cargo it carries (in pounds or tons). In general, one Large creature is equivalent to four Medium creatures, a Huge creature equals nine Medium creatures, and a Gargantuan creature equals sixteen Medium creatures. These comparisons assume that the vehicle has basically one horizontal surface upon which these creatures can stand. For covered vehicles or vehicles with multiple decks or levels, the number and size of creatures that can fit inside may vary. Regardless, a creature's size cannot exceed the available space in the vehicle.<br><br>Driver or Pilot: This entry describes the position a vehicle's driver or pilot occupies and any requirements of the vehicle's driver or pilot. Vehicles larger than Medium size usually require a driver or pilot to direct the vehicle from the front or rear. Thus, when placing a vehicle on the battle grid, you should decide which side is the front and which side is the rear.<br><br>Crew: This entry describes any crew needed to control a vehicle, and describes the effect on a vehicle's movement if the crew members are not present. <br><br>Out of Control: If a driver or pilot loses control of a vehicle, this entry describes what happens. <br><br>Special Features: If a vehicle has any attacks or special features, they are noted at the bottom of its statistics block.<br><br>Initiative: Vehicles never roll for initiative. A vehicle acts on the initiative of the creature controlling it. <br>    If you need to know when an out-of-control vehicle acts (for example, to determine when a driverless wagon moves across the battle grid), the vehicle has an initiative check result of 1 lower than the last creature in the initiative order. If the encounter involves multiple out-of-control vehicles, the vehicles act in order of which has been out of control longest, with the most recently out-of-control vehicle acting last.<br><br>VEHICLE AND MOUNT SPEEDS      <br></p><table><tr><th>Speed</th><th>Per Hour</th><th>Per 10-hour Day</th><th>Per 24-hour Day</th><tr><td>2 squares <td>1 mile <td>10 miles <td>24 miles <td> <tr><td>3 squares <td>1-1/2 miles <td>15 miles <td>36 miles <td> <tr><td>4 squares <td>2 miles <td>20 miles <td>48 miles <td> <tr><td>5 squares <td>2-1/2 miles <td>25 miles <td>60 miles <td> <tr><td>6 squares <td>3 miles <td>30 miles <td>72 miles <td> <tr><td>7 squares <td>3-1/2 miles <td>35 miles <td>84 miles <td> <tr><td>8 squares <td>4 miles <td>40 miles <td>96 miles <td> <tr><td>9 squares <td>4-1/2 miles <td>45 miles <td>108 miles <td> <tr><td>10 squares <td>5 miles <td>50 miles <td>120 miles <td> <tr><td>20 squares <td>10 miles <td>100 miles <td>240 miles</table><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 14.</p>","glossary669":"<h1 class=player>Weapons as Implements and Vice Versa</h1><p class=flavor>Some adventurers have the ability to use a weapon as an implement or an implement as a weapon, and some magic items grant this ability.

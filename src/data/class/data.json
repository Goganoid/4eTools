They might manifest as primal spirits hungering for revenge or as icy winds or crackling lightning. Your powers control your enemies, interfering with their movement, holding them in place, or injuring them for their actions. Also, your attacks might call forth spirits to worry your enemies and pursue them across the battlefield.<br><br>Religion: Like other primal characters, seekers view the world's primal spirits as kindred and partners, and they venerate them more than they worship the gods. Seekers who do follow deities commonly worship Melora for her dominion over the forces of nature, Corellon (who is sometimes depicted as the founder of archery), Kord, or Sehanine. Evil seekers sometimes follow Gruumsh or Zehir.<br><br>Races: Elves and shifters are the most common seekers, since both their natural inclinations toward primal paths and their inherent abilities make them well matched with the capabilities of the class. Goliaths who favor ranged combat sometimes become seekers (preferring thrown weapons over bows or crossbows), and wilden seekers are also fairly common.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 116.</p>","class352":"<h1 class=player>Hybrid Cleric</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. <br><b>Power Source: </b>Divine. <br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Wisdom, Strength, Charisma<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Implement: </b>Holy symbols<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 6+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2.5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3.5<br><br><b>Class Skills</b>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Religion (Int).<br><br><b>Class features: </b>Healer's Lore, Healing Word (Hybrid)<br><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Channel Divinity (Hybrid Cleric) or Cleric Armor Proficiency.<br></blockquote>By learning talents beyond those taught to the typical cleric, you have honed yourself into a distinctive divine leader.

The combat skills they possess are enhanced by the magic they wield. The flourish of a swordmage's blade not only bites with steel, but also with fire, lightning, or other powerful forces.<br>    You studied and practiced for years to master your skills. You mastered the fundamentals of arcane magic and combined this academic study with endless hours of physical training. You might be a young eladrin in search of your fortune, a stranger to the wider world outside the seclusion of your homeland; a self-trained genasi sellsword, gifted with an affinity for elemental magic; the scion of a disgraced noble human family, taught by the finest tutors in your youth but now a footloose expatriate; or a half-elf arcane champion, rigorously trained in a war magic academy to serve in the armies of your homeland.<br>    Magical barriers of force swirl around you, protecting you from harm. The blade you carry is an extension of your being, both body and mind. It pulses with eldritch energy as you prepare to defend your allies and unleash magical fury against your foes.<br><br><h3>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h3>The swordmage has two builds: assault swordmage and shielding swordmage. Intelligence plays into all your attacks, but you might emphasize either Strength or Constitution for added benefits.<br><h3>ASSAULT SWORDMAGE</h3>Your style of combat focuses on flashy attacks that call up elemental forces and throw your opponents around the battlefield. This method of aggressive swordmage combat spread from Returned Abeir to Toril through the heritage of the anarchs of Shyr. Your attacks use Intelligence, so that should be your primary ability score. Strength should be your second-best ability score, since it enhances your assault powers and keeps your base attack bonus high. Constitution helps your survivability and can be useful if you want to try some shielding swordmage powers. Most assault swordmages use a two-handed weapon (such as a greatsword or a falchion) to deal more damage, though they have a lower AC as a result.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Escalating Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>greenflame blade, sword burst</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>flame cyclone</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>burning blade</i><br><br><h3>ENSNARING SWORDMAGE</h3>You are a sly hunter who closes in on your prey, punishing an enemy for any missteps, and hounding it until it is vanquished. As an ensnaring swordmage, you are a clever defender who gains the tactically advantageous ground in a fight. You circle opponents and entrap them with careful swordplay, entangling spells, and cunning feints. You might also charge a foe to try to gain the advantage or to keep the creature from your allies.<br>Your use of spells to ensnare opponents requires physical and mental endurance. Intelligence should be your primary ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your spells. You should also have a high Constitution score to strengthen your ensnaring spells.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: aegis of ensnarement<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Grasping Ensnarement<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>luring strike, lightning lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox's feint</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>dragon's teeth</i><br><br><h3>SHIELDING SWORDMAGE</h3>You protect your allies with magical shields of force—and by keeping enemies away from them. This heritage is embodied by the Coronal Guard tradition, a discipline that can be traced over a thousand years to the armathors, the elite guards of the coronal of Myth Drannor. Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Constitution applies added effects to many of your attacks, so it should be your second-highest score. A good Strength lets you take advantage of assault swordmage powers (giving you some added offense) and keeps your basic attack decent. You'll want to keep a hand free to get your AC bonus from Swordmage Warding class feature, so you should use a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a scimitar.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Retributive Shield (Human feat: Student of Sword Magic)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>booming blade, lightning lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>chilling blow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>frost backlash</i><br><br><h3>SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Swordmages are smart, strong bastions of defense whose art is embodied by their swords.

Both a warrior and an arcanist, a hexblade uses a deadly combination of spells and fighting ability during combat.<br>    Few people trust hexblades. Although most common folk are at best suspicious of wizards, the typical mage isolates himself or herself while engaging in arcane study, rarely exposing the populace to deadly magic. Hexblades come by their power through an easier, and more easily mistrusted, path. Some of the greatest villains to plague the land have been hexblades. After stumbling across the rituals and incantations needed to contact and forge a bargain with a mighty entity, a marauding bandit or a bloodthirsty orc chieftain could become a hexblade. The entities that would grant power to hexblades care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the power provided to them by those to whom they give power through a pact. And such evil hexblades don't isolate themselves in the wild, but instead take what they want from those less powerful.<br>    Those few hexblades who prefer to be honorable face suspicion and persecution from a variety of quarters, because their magic is misunderstood and typically wielded by villains.

Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water.<br>    Since elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true. Like more conventional arcane magic, the elementalist's magic is a tool—and like any tool, it can be turned to evil ends or to good.<br><br><h3>SORCERER (ELEMENTALIST) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELEMENTAL BOLT</b><br>You gain the elemental bolt power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Elemental Bolt<span class=level>Sorcerer Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You hurl a spear of elemental energy at your foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Elemental</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Varies</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d12 + Charisma modifier damage.<br>    Level 21: 2d12 + Charisma modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: This power can be used as a ranged basic attack.</p><br><b>ELEMENTAL MAGIC</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    Elemental Power: You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Constitution modifier.

You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose.

Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br><br>RITUALS<br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals (see Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook).

Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains.<br>    Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy—whether by choice or not.<br>    Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters.<br><br><h3>VAMPIRE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BLOOD DRINKER</b><br>You gain the blood drinker power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Blood Drinker<span class=level>Vampire Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>When your attack strikes true, you sweep past your foe's defenses to consume the essence of its life.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit an enemy with a vampire melee at-will attack power.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack, and you gain a healing surge.<br>    Level 17: 2d10 extra damage.<br>    Level 27: 3d10 extra damage.</p><br><b>BLOOD IS LIFE</b><br>Once during a short rest, an ally adjacent to you can willingly lose one healing surge to allow you to regain hit points equal to your bloodied value.

Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need.

Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation.<br>    Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains.<br>    Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy.

The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells.<br>    The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (SHA'IR) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE</b><br>At the end of each extended rest, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Until the end of your next extended rest, you and your allies have resistance to that damage type while adjacent to the familiar when it is in active mode. The resistance equals your Constitution modifier. At level 21, the resistance increases to twice your Constitution modifier.<br><br><b>GEN SERVANT</b><br>You gain the Arcane Familiar feat as a bonus feat. You can choose any familiar normally available to a wizard or one of the familiars available only to sha'irs.<br>    At the end of each extended rest, when your familiar returns from its venture into the Elemental Chaos, you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level.<br><br><b>SHA'IR CANTRIPS</b><br>You gain four cantrips of your choice.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 106.</p>","class358":"<h1 class=player>Hybrid Warlock</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. <br><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. <br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Charisma, Constitution, Intelligence<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Implement: </b>Rods, wands<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 6+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2.5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3<br><br><b>Class Skills</b>: Arcana (Int), Bluff (Cha), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex).<br><br><b>Class features: </b>Eldritch Pact (Hybrid), Warlock's Curse (Hybrid)<br><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Prime Shot, Shadow Walk or Warlock Pact Boon.<br></blockquote>You draw power from snippets of arcane lore wrested from dusty tomes and primeval entities, but these secrets do not wholly define or limit your abilities.

You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br>    A Warlock's Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer.<br>    You can place a Warlock's Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action.

Some sentinels take up the profession with the expectation of becoming the leader or advisor of a frontier village. Others become hermits or wanderers, which leads naturally to the adventurer's life. However, all sentinels use their mastery of primal magic to help the people of the frontier survive hardships and maintain a respectful relationship with the natural world.<br>    As a sentinel, you draw power from the primal spirits—ancient guardians of the world that represent the countless aspects of nature. Although many denizens of the wild feel a connection to the primal spirits, you take that connection to its highest level. You are a creature of both the natural world and the spiritual world, whose task it is to stand against the forces that threaten both.<br><br><h3>DRUID (SENTINEL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ACOLYTE OF THE NATURAL CYCLE</b><br>At 1st level, each sentinel chooses a season that demonstrates his or her affinity for that aspect of nature's power. Your choice of season determines some of your class features, including the animal companion you gain.<br><br><b>Druid of Spring</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    ✦     Your animal companion is a wolf.<br>    ✦     You gain proficiency with the scimitar.<br>    ✦     You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with scimitars, spears, daggers, and sickles.<br>    ✦     You gain a +2 bonus to Heal checks.<br><br><b>Druid of Summer</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    ✦     Your animal companion is a bear.<br>    ✦     When wielding a one-handed mace, you use a d10 for its weapon damage.

It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be.<br>    You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics.<br>    Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.<br>    Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points.<br>    If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back:<br>    * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.<br>    * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.<br>    As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.<br>    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.<br>    In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do).<br>    An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions.<br><br><b>Druid of Spring: Wolf</b><br>You gain a wolf animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of Summer: Bear</b><br>You gain a bear animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of the Wastes: Living Zephyr</b><br>You gain a living zephyr animal companion.<br><br><b>COMBINED ATTACK</b><br>You gain the combined attack power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Combined Attack<span class=level>Druid Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your animal companion waits for the signal of your own attack, then pushes in with a devastating follow-up that your foe never sees coming.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.<br>Level 17: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.<br>Level 27: 3[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Your animal companion can take a free action to move up to its speed and then use its animal attack.</p><br><b>DRUID WILDERNESS KNACKS</b><br>You gain two of the following abilities of your choice.<br><br><b>Beast Empathy (Druid)</b><br>You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts.

They are expected to further their deity's interests throughout their lives, aiding all who work in the deity's name (whether they realize it or not) and opposing any who seek to thwart the deity's will. Templars try to sway the good people of the world to give honor and worship to the gods by setting an example of courage, understanding, patience, piety, and zeal.

Monks tap into the psionic potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds.<br><br>Perhaps you set out on this path to put a dark past behind you.

Your psionic power infuses your strikes with speed and accuracy.<br>    Like other monks, you should put your highest score in Dexterity because you depend on it for your attacks. Its origin among the common folk means that the Iron Soul tradition focuses on toughness, so make Constitution your second highest score.

When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see “Implements” below).<br><br><b>UNARMORED DEFENSE</b><br>While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.<br><br>Full Discipline<br>Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack.<br>You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.<br>The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type—at-will or encounter—and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round. <br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Monks usually channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus, which is a wooden practice weapon, prayer beads, a manual of lore, or some other object a monk studies or uses during training or meditation. After you attune yourself to a ki focus, you can use it as an implement when it is on your person (see the “Ki Focuses” sidebar).<br><br>When you wear or hold your ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of monk powers and monk paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.<br><br>You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. When wielding the weapon as an implement, the weapon's characteristics—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties like defensive or high crit—are irrelevant to your implement powers.<br><br>If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon with the same attack.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 62.</p>","class602":"<h1 class=player>Runepriest</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader.

Legend holds that the gods crafted a set of powerful runes, each imbued with a core of divine power, to help create the world and give it order. During the long war against the primordials, many of these runes were lost. Even the gods only dimly recall the runes of power. Somewhere in the forgotten depths of a dungeon or the isolated corner of the planes, those ancient runes wait to be discovered. A runepriest can learn much in the peaceful halls of a temple, but sooner or later he or she must put on armor and go forth to find or create a new rune, and in so doing earn a name among the masters of rune magic.<br><br>You learned the art of rune smithing from your master. Perhaps you sweated over a forge deep within a dwarven stronghold, crafting weapons and armor for the faithful as part of your apprenticeship. Or you might have helped inscribe runes in the living wood of the forest, crafting signs to warn of approaching enemies. Along the way, you learned how to take inscribed runes and turn them into words and signs of power that you can incorporate into your prayers. But now, the time for learning is at an end. Now is the time for adventure.<br><br>Merge the runes of power with your weapons and armor. Call to the gods and channel their might against your enemies. The runes are your weapons, and the gods' foes await your judgment.<br><br><h3>CREATING A RUNEPRIEST</h3>Your choice of ability scores, powers, and Runic Artistry tradition suggests one of two builds based on the two most ancient runepriest traditions, the path of the Wrathful Hammer and the way of the Defiant Word. All runepriests use Strength for their attacks. Constitution increases the effect of certain runepriest powers, while Wisdom bolsters others.<br><h3>DEFIANT RUNEPRIEST</h3>A length of paper inscribed with runes might appear fragile, yet it hangs from the eaves of a temple day after day, shrugging off rain, snow, cold, and heat. The way of the Defiant Word holds that runes, wherever they are inscribed, provide strength not merely by the power they employ, but by binding together an object or a person and the concept held within a rune. As a defiant runepriest, you fight on the front lines, sustaining and aiding your allies with divine runes. You focus your efforts on the most dangerous enemies, using your magic to restrict their attacks and shield your allies from harm. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Choose the Defiant Word as your path of Runic Artistry, and select powers that don't simply destroy your foes with brute force, but foil their efforts. These choices incline you toward controller as your secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Defiant Word<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Rune of Hope<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, History, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>word of binding, word of exchange</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>divine rune of thunder</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>rune of the undeniable dawn</i><br><br><h3>WRATHFUL RUNEPRIEST</h3>Runepriests who follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer inscribe their runes in stone, metal, and ironwood, materials that can withstand the punishing forces that the runes channel. As a wrathful runepriest, you lead the attack against the forces of evil. Your place is at the forefront of any battle, using your hammer to smite your enemies. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Choose the path of the Wrathful Hammer as your form of Runic Artistry, and select powers that inspire allies around you and wrap your foes in magic that punishes them for not following your edicts. These choices incline you toward defender as your secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Wrathful Hammer<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Rune of Vengeance<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>word of diminishment, word of shielding</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>anvil of battle</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>rune of endless fire</i><br><br><h3>RUNEPRIEST CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>RUNE MASTER</b><br>Some of your powers have the runic keyword. When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Destruction</b><br>Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Protection</b><br>While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level.<br><br><b>RUNE OF MENDING</b><br>You gain the rune of mending power. This rune restores your allies' health and grants them additional power based on your rune state.<br><br><b>RUNIC ARTISTRY</b><br>Runepriests follow one of the major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer, the way of the Defiant Word or the tradition of the Serene Blade.<br><br><b>Defiant Word</b><br>Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round.<br><br><b>Serene Blade</b><br>You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Once per round immediately after an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level.<br><br><b>Wrathful Hammer</b><br>You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces. In addition, whenever an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy damages you in a round.<br><br>RUNEPRIEST OVERVIEW<br>Characteristics: You use melee attacks to harass your enemies and leave them vulnerable to your allies' attacks. With your heavy armor and your ability to heal, you are ideally suited for standing on the front line.<br><br>Religion: Runepriests are found among the followers of all the gods, but they most commonly worship Corellon, Erathis, Ioun, or Moradin. Moradin is a patron of smiths and other artisans who seek to master a craft. Many runepriests create fine goods as they practice their ability to forge runes. Corellon attracts runepriests who view the inscribing of runes as an art. Ioun values the protective aspects of rune magic and the knowledge contained in the runes. Erathis favors inventors and others who seek knowledge, a perfect match for runepriests who seek to uncover or create new runes.<br><br>Races: Deva runepriests favor the way of the Defiant Word and create beautiful illuminated manuscripts of religious lore, building libraries that grow for generations in hidden corners of the Astral Sea. Elf runepriests also embrace this path, tending trees and other plants to grow in runic patterns to honor the gods. Dwarves, minotaurs, and goliaths commonly follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer. In great caverns, divine runes decorate dwarven chapels as well as secluded minotaur shrines. Goliath runepriests carve massive runes atop their holy peaks, marking the territory as warded by the gods and serving as landmarks for their people as they migrate from one mountain to the next.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 98.</p>","class722":"<h1 class=player>Wizard (Mage)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Controller. <br><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. <br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence; Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Dagger, quarterstaff.<br><b>Implement: </b>Orbs, staffs, wands<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 10+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 4<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: Arcana.

This specialization makes each mage distinctive. After all, a mage who casts evocation spells presents a very different picture to the world from a mage who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment.<br>    Mages tend to approach arcane magic with a more scholarly bent than other wizards, and that's saying a lot. Don't expect to find adventuring mages hidden away in dusty towers, however. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding of everything arcane—and thereby increase their personal power.<br>    The ancient traditions of the schools have been handed down since the first mortals began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually became more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild. In time, single towers devoted to a single arcane discipline gave way to grand academies where illusion magic was taught alongside evocation magic.<br>    Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprentices at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of mages in all of the schools of magic.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (MAGE) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>LEVEL 1 APPRENTICE MAGE</b><br>Choose a school of magic.

These are the powers that you can use during that day, in addition to your at-will attack powers, cantrips, and nonwizard powers, such as a racial power. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day.<br>    Find your level on the Spells Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers you are allowed to prepare each day. You cannot prepare more than one encounter attack power, daily attack power, or utility power of any given level on the same day. For example, a 14th-level mage who has taken the enigmatic mage paragon path can prepare four encounter attack powers per day. Her spellbook contains multiple encounter attack powers at various levels. She can prepare four powers from any of the levels, as long as none of the prepared powers are of the same level.<br><br>SPELLS PREPARED PER DAY<br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Encounter</th><th>Daily</th><th>Utility</th><tr><td>1<td>1<td>1<td>—<tr><td>2<td>1<td>1<td>1<tr><td>3-4<td>2<td>1<td>1<tr><td>5<td>2<td>2<td>1<tr><td>6<td>2<td>2<td>2<tr><td>7-8<td>3<td>2<td>2<tr><td>9<td>3<td>3<td>2<tr><td>10-15<td>3<td>3<td>3<tr><td>16-21<td>3<td>3<td>4<tr><td>22-30<td>3<td>3<td>5</table><br>*Certain wizard paragon paths, such as the enigmatic mage, allow you to prepare one additional spell per day in certain cases.<br><br><b>MAGIC MISSILE</b><br>You gain the magic missile power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Magic Missile<span class=level>Wizard Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A glowing blue bolt of magical energy hurtles from your finger and unerringly strikes your target.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Evocation</b>, <b>Force</b>, <b>Implement</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: 2 + Intelligence modifier force damage.<br>    Level 11: 3 + Intelligence modifier force damage.<br>    Level 21: 5 + Intelligence modifier force damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: If the implement used with this power has an enhancement bonus, add that bonus to the damage.

Do your druid powers stem from an innate but undeveloped link to primal spirits? Or have you just begun to explore the mysteries of nature after a life spent in other pursuits? <br>As a hybrid druid, you can assume beast form and likely know powers useful in that form.

You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Wild Shape<span class=level>Druid Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your humanoid form.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa.

The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br>    You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items.

These warriors form the iron core of any legion. They crash into the teeth of enemy forces, armed with cold steel and grim purpose. They are the mercenaries loitering in taverns between expeditions, the guards who cast a watchful eye over their charges, the weapon masters who elevate fighting styles to lethal arts. The weaponmaster is a fearless warrior, ready to meet any challenge.<br>    Weaponmasters can be found just about anywhere and among any sort of people. A few are gallant warriors fighting for noble causes, while others are calculating mercenaries who draw their weapons only when the pay is right. All weaponmasters, however, are adventurers, ready to face any challenge, to go where glory, plunder, or honor leads them.<br>    Specialized combat maneuvers, or exploits, combined with a dedicated focus on a fighting style set weaponmasters apart from other fighters. A weaponmaster can slam his or her weapon through one enemy to crunch into another or carve a bloody path through enemies in a whirlwind of destruction. Weapons are crucial too, since weaponmasters know how to coax every advantage they can from their tools, and those who use axes fight differently from those who favor heavy blades.<br>    Compared to a knight or a slayer, a weaponmaster focuses on a broader variety of tactics and combat styles. While a knight or a slayer has fairly predictable, though still formidable, abilities, each weaponmaster cultivates a unique blend of specific maneuvers and abilities.<br>    Weaponmasters develop their combat prowess in many different ways. Most have some elementary training to expose them to different weapons and armor. These trainees are often squires, militia, students, and soldiers. Once they're cut free, they grow their ability through practice and observation. Each battle proves instructive, giving the weaponmaster new insights that might develop into full-blown techniques.<br><br><h3>CREATING A FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER)</h3><br><h3>ARENA FIGHTER</h3>Years spent in death matches, squaring off against humanoid and monstrous foes, have prepared you to face any enemy. You learned to fight by scrapping in the sand and struggling against the arena-masters' pets. You are a cut above the rest, a champion born of the arenas of Athas and destined for much more.<br>    You bring cunning and speed to the battlefield. You have a daring unknown to those whose feet have never touched the arena floor. Rather than hide behind heavy armor, you rely on agility and your mastery of weapons to deflect your enemies' attacks. Unburdened by heavy armor, you can leap into the fray to strike several enemies at once.<br>    The arena lures more fighters to its bloody fields than members of any other class. Fighters have the weapon training, the armor training, and the adaptability to respond to a variety of threats. Any fighter build might be appropriate in Athas's arenas, but the arena fighter represents the epitome of combat in the coliseums.<br>    As with other fighters, Strength should be your highest ability score, because you use it for your attack powers. You'll wear light armor, so a high Dexterity can help offset your lower Armor Class. Make Dexterity your second-highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to improve your battlefield intuition and your Will defense, or pick Constitution if you need extra hit points and healing surges. Select powers that increase your mobility and help you control the battlefield. The ideal powers let you strike or hinder several enemies. Your secondary role is controller.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>master's edge</i><br><br><h3>BATTLERAGER FIGHTER</h3>You're an unpredictable warrior who trusts the adrenaline rush of battle to pull you through as much as heavy armor does. Few aspects of life give you the charge that being in the heat of battle does, and you build up a fury when your enemies manage to hurt you. You thrive on taking it to those foes by wielding highly damaging weapons such as axes, maces, hammers, and picks. Strength is your focus, allowing you to make powerful attacks. You rely on Constitution to give weight to your attacks and to keep you in the fight. Like any other soldier, you count on brutal instinct to help you win the day, so Wisdom is important to you as well. The Battlerager Vigor class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human feat: Durable)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>brash strike, crushing surge</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bell ringer</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>knee breaker</i><br><br><h3>BRAWLING FIGHTER</h3>You have an instinct for mayhem. You fight with a one-handed weapon and leave a hand open so you can punch, grab, and throw. Your body is your best weapon. Every battlefield holds opportunities for a brawling fighter, whether it's a wall you throw a foe against, furniture with which to trip an enemy, or stones you can employ as deadly projectiles.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Brawler Style, Combat Agility<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Inescapable Hold<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grappling strike, slash and pummel</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bash and pinion</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>seize and stab</i><br><br><h3>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTER</h3>You're interested in dealing out the most damage you can. You prefer big two-handed weapons such as the greatsword or greataxe. You're more interested in fighting hard than fighting smart. Your best ability score is definitely Strength. A good Constitution improves your ability to use high damage weapons, such as axes and hammers. Plus, extra hit points always help. Select powers that work well with two-handed weapons to make the most of this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>cleave, reaping strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>spinning sweep</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>brute strike</i><br><br><h3>GUARDIAN FIGHTER</h3>To fight better, you fight smarter. You're willing to trade offense for superior defenses and better ability to control the battlefield around you. You fight with a heavy shield and a good one-handed weapon, such as a longsword, flail, or battleaxe. Like the great weapon fighter, you make Strength your best ability score. After that, prioritize your Dexterity to take advantage of weapons that can be improved by Dexterity-based feats, or your Wisdom to make the most of the combat superiority class feature. You're hard to hurt and hard to move away from. Select powers that make use of your one-handed weapon and shield, as well as take advantage of your higher Dexterity score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>sure strike, tide of iron</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>covering attack</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>comeback strike</i><br><br><h3>TEMPEST FIGHTER</h3>Rather than a shield or a big weapon, you have specialized in fighting using a weapon in each hand. You see it as the best of both worlds—given the right training, you can deliver good damage and make up for the lack of a shield with deft parrying. Strength remains any soldier's bread and butter, and good battlefield awareness—Wisdom—is a must. You also rely on speed, maneuverability, and agility—Dexterity—to get your dirty work done. Constitution is a tertiary ability for you, granting useful staying power against foes not so easily fooled by your fancy footwork and feints. The Tempest Technique class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Two-Weapon Fighting (Human feat: Two-Weapon Threat)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>dual strike, footwork lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>funneling flurry</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>tempest dance</i><br><br><h3>FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>COMBAT AGILITY</b><br>This class feature replaces the Combat Superiority class feature.

Amid the chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act as partners, matching awe-inspiring beauty with an awful deadliness. When the bladesinger engages in the true heart of the art, when the sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, when the bladesong has begun—then the bladesinger becomes something unreal, something timeless.<br>    According to legend, Corellon himself inspired and taught the first bladesinger. The techniques handed down as a gift from the leader of the elven deities have passed from one to another among the Tel'Quessir for untold generations, and though different styles evolved as eladrin and elves turned its power to suit their needs, none have improved upon the essential core of the art.<br>    The bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free or using it to employ a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger the speed and freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow for both magical and physical attacks to flow freely.<br>    Few among the Tel'Quessir have the honor of being inducted into the bladesingers. One must have the mind necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancer. Yet those traits alone are not enough. A bladesinger is first and foremost devoted to the ways and the people of the Tel'Quessir, for that was the purpose of Corellon's gift.<br>    A bladesinger who has set out beyond the borders of a nation of the People must have had good cause. Adventuring bladesingers might seek out relics or locations of great meaning to the Tel'Quessir, or they could leave in order to guard a specific person or group against harm. A bladesinger might instead embark upon a quest to eliminate a threat to the People or to find and communicate with some long-lost branch of the race. In a more tragic case, a bladesinger might have failed in the duty to protect a community and be death-pledged to avenge it and restore his or her honor.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (BLADESINGER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BLADE MAGIC</b><br>Choose a one-handed melee weapon with which you have proficiency, and that is a light blade or a heavy blade.

At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level.<br>    The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook.<br>    Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers.<br>    Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.) You cannot prepare more than one attack power and one utility power of any given level on the same day.<br><br>WIZARD POWERS LEARNED<br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Encounter as Daily</th><th>Utility</th><tr><td>1<td>2<td>—<tr><td>2<td>—<td>2<tr><td>3–4<td>—<td>—<tr><td>5<td>2<td>—<tr><td>6<td>—<td>2<tr><td>7–8<td>—<td>—<tr><td>9<td>2<td>—<tr><td>10<td>—<td>2<tr><td>11–14<td>—<td>—<tr><td>15<td>2<td>—<tr><td>16<td>—<td>2<tr><td>17–18<td>—<td>—<tr><td>19<td>2<td>—<tr><td>20–21<td>—<td>—<tr><td>22<td>—<td>2<tr><td>23–24<td>—<td>—<tr><td>25<td>2<td>—<tr><td>26–28<td>—<td>—<tr><td>29<td>2<td>—<tr><td>30<td>—<td>—</table><br><br>WIZARD POWERS PREPARED PER DAY<br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Encounter as Daily</th><th>Utility</th><tr><td>1<td>1<td>—<tr><td>2–4<td>1<td>1<tr><td>5<td>2<td>1<tr><td>6–8<td>2<td>2<tr><td>9<td>3<td>2<tr><td>10–15<td>3<td>3<tr><td>16–21<td>3<td>4<tr><td>22–30<td>3<td>5</table><br><br><b>BLADESONG</b><br>You gain the bladesong power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Bladesong<span class=level>Wizard Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your whirling blade begins to sing through the air as you enter a state of total concentration.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no weapon or shield in the other hand.

They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers.<br>Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force.<br>A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them. You whistle three staccato notes, letting your allies know the symphony of battle is about to begin.<br><br><h3>CREATING A BARD</h3>Your choice of ability scores, class features, and powers suggests one of two builds based on the storied virtues of cunning and valor. All bards use Charisma for their attacks. Intelligence increases the effect of tricky attacks, and Constitution is best for powers that inspire allies.<br><h3>CUNNING BARD</h3>The heroes of the past whom you hold as exemplars overcame adversity and escaped danger using their wits, by tricking their foes and concocting cunning stratagems. You seek to emulate those heroes, combining your winning personality with a keen intellect. You use Charisma for your attack powers, so make it your highest score, followed by Intelligence to improve the effects of your tricky powers. Constitution is a good third score. Look for powers that let you put your cunning to work. Most cunning bards focus on ranged attack powers, using a wand from a safe distance to orchestrate the flow of battle.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Cunning<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Advantage of Cunning<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Intimidate, Perception, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>misdirected mark, vicious mockery</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>blunder</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>stirring shout</i><br><br><h3>PRESCIENT BARD</h3>You have the foresight to navigate the twisting roads of luck and fate, emulating those heroes who were able to sense the truths beyond mere reality. By manipulating luck and glimpsing the future, you help your allies exploit every advantage, attacking your enemies' weakest defenses and avoiding mishaps in combat. You wield a ranged weapon, with which you can cast spells at enemies from a distance while inspiring allies. As with other bards, you use Charisma for your attack powers, so it should be your highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your second-highest score, since it enhances the effects of powers that use the Virtue of Prescience. A decent Intelligence score is useful for improving your Armor Class and Reflex defense, as well as boosting the knowledge skills that you often use.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Prescience<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Extended Prescience<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>guiding strike, jinx shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>prophesied strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>arrow of warning</i><br><br><h3>VALOROUS BARD</h3>To your mind, the ancient heroes most worthy of emulation are those whose courage in the face of overwhelming odds carried them to victory. Your own fortitude and forceful personality inspire similar valor in your allies. Your highest ability score should be Charisma, since you use it for attack powers, followed by Constitution to improve your powers of inspiration. It's a good idea to make Intelligence your third score. Choose powers that emphasize valor and endurance in the face of adversity. Most valorous bards focus on melee and close attack powers, wielding a sword in the thick of battle and leading by example.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Valor<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Strength of Valor<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>guiding strike, war song strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shout of triumph</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>slayer's song</i><br><br><h3>BARD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Each bard has the powers majestic word and words of friendship.<br><br><b>BARDIC TRAINING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.

At 11th level, you can perform two bard rituals per day of your level or lower without expending components; at 21st level, you can perform three.<br><br><b>BARDIC VIRTUE</b><br>Bards praise many virtues in their stories, telling tales of people whose particular qualities set them above common folk. The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality.<br>    Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Virtue of Cunning</b><br>Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action.<br><br><b>Virtue of Prescience</b><br>Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy's turn.<br><br><b>Virtue of Valor</b><br>Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action.

Without a wand, you can still use these powers.<br>    Songblades and some magic musical instruments (see Chapter 3) can be used as implements for bard powers and bard paragon path powers.

Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.<br><br>You might not share your fellow battleminds' arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.<br><br>Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.<br><br><h3>CREATING A BATTLEMIND</h3>Battleminds rely on Constitution, Charisma, and Wisdom for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many battleminds choose powers that complement their choice of combat style.<br><h3>HARRIER BATTLEMIND</h3>As a harrier battlemind, you move with ease across the battlefield, whether taking the fight to your enemies or falling back to draw them closer to you. Choose powers that facilitate movement, with teleportation powers being the most important. Your secondary role is controller, which can be strengthened by area powers that manipulate or hamper your opponents. Your feat selection should improve your defenses and mobility.<br>    Make Constitution your highest ability score. Dexterity should be your second-highest score, getting you into the fight quickly and letting you avoid heavy armor to keep moving at full speed in combat. A high Wisdom allows you to improve your battlefield awareness, and Charisma remains important for the many battlemind disciplines that rely on that skill.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Persistent Harrier<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Harrying Step<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>renewed focus, worldslipping advance</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Persistent Harrier<br>Feat: Harrying Step<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: renewed focus, worldslipping advance<br>Daily Power: accelerating strike</i><br><br><h3>QUICK BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to make yourself faster, increasing your speed and agility in combat. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Charisma to reflect your ability to project your psionic power into the world. Wisdom should be your third-best ability. For daily powers, consider those that grant new opportunity actions to you, ensuring that your foes can't outmaneuver you.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Speed of Thought<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Speed of Thought<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demon dance, whirling defense</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Speed of Thought<br>Feat: Improved Speed of Thought<br>Skills: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: demon dance, whirling defense<br>Daily Power: steel unity strike</i><br><br><h3>RESILIENT BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to transform your body, altering it to take on the qualities of iron or stone, or to transform your weapon so it hits harder or bypasses your foes' protections. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom to reflect the strong mental control you have over your physical state. Charisma is a good third choice. For daily powers, consider those that alter your form and provide additional augmentations you can use for your other powers.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Battle Resilience<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Deceptive Mind<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>iron fist, bull's strength</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Battle Resilience<br>Feat: Deceptive Mind<br>Skills: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br>At-Will Powers: iron fist, bull's strength<br>Daily Power: aspect of elevated harmony</i><br><br><h3>WILD BATTLEMIND</h3>The use of psionic power is widespread on Athas, and many warriors take up the career of the battlemind. Battleminds are hardy and cunning, two characteristics essential to survival on Athas. Self-taught or informally trained, wild battleminds rely on instinct. These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism.<br>    The wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It's not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas.<br>    The deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle.<br>    Like other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers. Select Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to dabble in powers from other battlemind builds.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Wild Focus<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>concussive spike, whirling defense</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Wild Focus<br>Feat: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement)<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>At-Will Powers: concussive spike, whirling defense<br>Daily Power: corona of floating force</i><br><br><h3>BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Battleminds have the following class features.<br><br><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br>    <br>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br>    <br>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br>    <br>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><b>PSIONIC DEFENSE</b><br>Three powers—battlemind's demand, blurred step, and mind spike—help you maintain tactical superiority in combat. You can use these psionic powers to demand your enemies' attention, follow them if they try to avoid you, and punish them if they attack your allies. This combination of mental compulsion and psionic enhancement of your own capabilities makes you a force to be reckoned with in battle.<br><br><b>PSIONIC STUDY</b><br>Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.<br><br><b>Battle Resilience</b><br>You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Battle Resilience<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You steel yourself for battle, girding yourself against your foe's initial assault.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.<br>Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier.<br>Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><br><br><b>Persistent Harrier</b><br>You gain the persistent harrier power, which reflects the ease with which you can outmaneuver your opponents.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Persistent Harrier<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You slip the bonds of space to strike back at even a distant opponent.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Teleportation</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits or misses you with an attack for the first time during an encounter</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=flavor><b>Special</b>: You can attack the target with this melee attack even if the target is outside your melee reach.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Constitution vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Constitution modifier damage, and you teleport to a square adjacent to the enemy.<br>    Level 21: 2[W] + Constitution modifier damage.</p><br>Update (8/16/2011)<br>Changed in September update.<br><br><br><b>Speed of Thought</b><br>You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Speed of Thought<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You move in the blink of an eye, reaching your foes before they can draw their weapons.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You roll initiative</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power even if you're surprised.</p><br><br><b>Wild Focus</b><br>You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wild Focus<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Using a surge of telekinetic power, you yank an enemy toward you, forcing it to fight.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy starts its first turn during an encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You pull the target a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier and mark it until the end of your next turn.</p><br><br>BATTLEMIND OVERVIEW<br><br>Characteristics: Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies' attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc.<br><br>Religion: Battleminds who live up to this class's renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic.<br><br>Races: Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths' sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 42.</p>","class4":"<h1 class=player>Paladin</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender.

Paladins smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. Paladins are transfigured on the field of battle, exemplars of divine ethos in action.<br>    To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.<br>    Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory!<br><br><h3>CREATING A PALADIN</h3>Paladins rely on Strength, Charisma, and Wisdom for most of their key abilities and powers. Constitution is useful as well, although no paladin powers are specifically based on Constitution.<br><h3>ARDENT PALADIN</h3>Your brutal assaults demonstrate the power of your god's wrath. You're more like a striker than other paladins are. You willingly sacrifice your own health and defense to strike down your foes, even giving up some healing ability to be a more powerful attacker. The ardent vow power allows you to focus on a specific opponent, dealing additional damage with attacks and keeping that foe's attention on you. This power also enhances powers that work better against enemies marked by you.<br>Take Strength as your highest ability score, since you use it for many attacks and damage. Wisdom should be your second-highest score, to maximize the number of uses you get of ardent vow. A good Constitution score can help soothe the sting of powers that require you to spend some of your own hit points for best effect. Because of this build's focus on dealing damage, choose a weapon with the best possible damage capacity, typically a two-handed weapon.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: ardent vow<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Mighty Challenge<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Insight, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>ardent strike, valiant strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>divine pursuit</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>blood of the mighty</i><br><br><h3>AVENGING PALADIN</h3>You burn with the desire to punish the wicked and smite the unbelievers. In your view, the best way to safeguard your allies is to destroy your enemies with divine power and overwhelming attacks. Choose Strength as your highest ability score, since your most damaging attacks are based on Strength. Charisma should be your second-best ability score, and Wisdom your third. Consider wielding a big two-handed weapon such as a greatsword or greataxe, and choose powers that deliver the highest amount of damage.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human Feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>holy strike, valiant strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>radiant smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>paladin's judgment</i><br><br><h3>PROTECTING PALADIN</h3>You emphasize defense, guarding your allies, and healing and bolstering them with a few of your powers. You do not deal as much damage as the avenging paladin, but you are better at dealing with a wider array of situations. Your best ability score should be Charisma. Choose Strength for your second-best score (you'll want a few Strength-based attacks), and Wisdom as your third-best score. The protecting paladin works best as a shield-carrying warrior, so you should probably use a heavy shield and a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a warhammer. Select powers that help your allies, along with a few damage-dealing powers for when the need arises.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Healing Hands (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bolstering strike, enfeebling strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shielding smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>radiant delirium</i><br><br><h3>VIRTUOUS PALADIN</h3>You are a tower of faith; enchantments and dreadful powers wielded by your foes can find little purchase in your devoted heart. Like the protecting paladin, you shield your companions, but you do so while protecting yourself so that you can stay in the fight. No matter how your enemies attack you, you excel at resisting conditions that would impede others. As a warrior of exceptional piety, you also make more use of your holy symbol than other paladins do. You have several options for engaging enemies at range, so that even foes beyond your weapon's reach cannot escape your challenge.<br>Your highest ability score should be Charisma. Choose Wisdom for your second-best score, since a good Wisdom enhances the effects of many of your powers. Strength should be your third-best score. First choose powers that let you make extra saving throws or use healing surges, then powers that bolster your allies or deal high damage. You should wield a shield and a one-handed weapon, since having high defenses is a goal of this build.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: virtue's touch<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Virtuous Recovery<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bolstering strike, virtuous strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>valorous smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>majestic halo</i><br><br><h3>PALADIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Your armor, your shield, and your weapon are the most important tools of your trade. In addition, you have the following class features. Your lay on hands class feature can be replaced by the ardent vow or the virtue's touch class feature.<br><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>DIVINE CHALLENGE</b><br>The challenge of a paladin is filled with divine menace. You can use the divine challenge power to mark an enemy of your choice. <br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Divine Challenge<span class=level>Paladin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You boldly confront a nearby enemy, searing it with divine light if it ignores your challenge.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target.

Instead, the target regains hit points as if it had spent a healing surge. You must have at least one healing surge remaining to use this power.</p><br>DIVINE SANCTION<br>Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.<br>Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.<br>Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.<br><br>PALADINS AND DEITIES<br>As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.<br>    Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.<br><br>Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities<br><table><tr><th>Deity</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Areas of Influence</th><tr><td>Avandra<td>Good<td>Change, luck, trade, travel<tr><td>Bahamut<td>Lawful Good<td>Justice, honor, nobility, protection<tr><td>Corellon<td>Unaligned<td>Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts<tr><td>Erathis<td>Unaligned<td>Civilization, invention, laws<tr><td>Ioun<td>Unaligned<td>Knowledge, prophecy, skill<tr><td>Kord<td>Unaligned<td>Storms, strength, battle<tr><td>Melora<td>Unaligned<td>Wilderness, sea<tr><td>Moradin<td>Lawful Good<td>Creation, artisans, family<tr><td>Pelor<td>Good<td>Sun, summer, agriculture, time<tr><td>Raven Queen<td>Unaligned<td>Death, fate, winter<tr><td>Sehanine<td>Unaligned<td>Trickery, moon, love, autumn</table><br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Paladins make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A paladin wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a paladin can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.<br>    A holy avenger, a special magic weapon, can also be used as an implement for paladin powers, as well as paladin paragon path powers. These weapons are highly sought after by paladins.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 89.</p>","class784":"<h1 class=player>Paladin (Cavalier)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender.

Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof ), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.<br>    Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.<br>    At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.<br>    As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.<br>    The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.<br><br><h3>PALADIN (CAVALIER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DEFENDER AURA</b><br>You gain the defender aura power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Defender Aura<span class=level>Fighter Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You work to occupy nearby foes using a combination of fighting skill and clever tactics to keep them distracted.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Aura</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 1 that lasts until you end it as a minor action or until you fall unconscious.

They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. <br><br>As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. <br><br>With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ARTIFICER</h3>Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items.<br><h3>BATTLESMITH ARTIFICER</h3>You weave strands of magic and thread them into items and allies. With these infusions, weapons become stronger, armor becomes tougher, and allies become more durable. You should make Intelligence your highest ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your attack powers. Constitution helps augment your spells' damage and defense boosts, so it should be your second highest ability. A good Wisdom score can help bolster your Will and support any powers you take outside your specialty.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception,Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>aggravating force, static shock</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>burning weapons</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>icebound sigil</i><br><br><h3>TINKERER ARTIFICER</h3>Using whatever materials are on hand, you empower weapons and armors and even create allies. You imbue each of your creations with magic, elemental spirits, and a spark of life, giving it the power to perform a specific task. Your attack powers are based on Intelligence, so it should be your primary ability score. Your second-best ability score should be Wisdom, which enhances the artifices and the constructs you create. Other artificer powers rely on Constitution, so that should be your third highest ability score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>magic weapon, thundering armor</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>spike wire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>obedient servant</i><br><br><h3>WARRIOR FORGE ARTIFICER</h3>The warrior forge artificer fights from a distance, using implement and ranged weapon attacks to deliver punishment away from the front lines. The warrior forge artificer turns his allies into his weapons, while at the same time providing them with defensive bonuses so that they can stand up to the increased punishment that comes with having one less character in melee combat. Assign your highest ability score to Intelligence, and your second highest to Wisdom. The build offers a path of powers for implement users, as well as one for weapon users, but you can mix and match if you so choose.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flameburst armor</i><br><br><h3>ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>You have the following class features.<br><br><b>ARCANE EMPOWERMENT</b><br>Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.<br><br><b>Augment Energy</b><br>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way.<br><br><b>Impart Energy</b><br>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way.<br><br><b>ARCANE REJUVENATION</b><br>Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer's allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br><b>HEALING INFUSION</b><br>You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.<br><br>You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended.<br><br>When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture<span class=level>Artificer Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You use the magic of your infusion to heal the wounds of your target.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature.<br>Level 6: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 2.<br>Level 11: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 4.<br>Level 16: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 6.<br>Level 21: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 8.<br>Level 26: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 10.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round.

In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.<br><br>Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 44.</p>","class705":"<h1 class=player>Cleric (Warpriest)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. <br><b>Power Source: </b>Divine. <br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Wisdom, Constitution<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail; heavy shields, light shields.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Implement: </b>Holy symbols<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 7+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: Religion.

Using that magic to back up impressive martial ability, warpriests serve as the shield of their faith. Warpriests protect the innocent from marauding monsters and lead adventuring expeditions into the dark unknown. They are drawn to the borderlands between the scattered settlements of civilization and the realms of chaos. There, they attend the spiritual and military needs of the population.<br>    Warpriests occupy the middle ground between the wizard and the fighter. They are trained to use weapons and armor, but it is their induction into the mysteries of divine magic that makes them unique.

You prefer ranged attack powers, and you resort to melee only when there are no good targets left for your arrows. Most of your attack powers use Dexterity, so Dexterity should be your highest ability score. You find yourself in melee from time to time, so Strength is a good choice for your second-highest score. Wisdom should be your third-best ability score. Choose powers that reflect your preference for ranged weapons.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>careful attack, nimble strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>evasive strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>split the tree</i><br><br><h3>BEASTMASTER RANGER</h3>A deadly hunter, you specialize in double-teaming your enemies with the aid of a beast companion. Your beast is an extension of you, and thereby it is an invaluable member of your group. No other is needed to help you flank your quarry. Melee combat with the aid of your beast is your focus, so you favor Strength. You count on Dexterity for your AC and occasional ranged attacks, so your secondary focus is on that ability score. Wisdom, your tertiary ability score, makes you better at the Perception skill and gives you an edge with many ranger powers. The Beast Mastery class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Improved Initiative)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>circling strike, predator strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>synchronized strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>partnered savaging</i><br><br><h3>HUNTER RANGER</h3>Stealthy and agile, you are a talented skirmisher who adapts to overcome any combat scenario. Although you resemble the archer ranger, your powers provide you with mobility and more melee options. You are unrivaled in your ability to fight well at any range.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Hunter Fighting Style, Running Attack<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>fading strike, twin strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>skirmish shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>skirmishing stance</i><br><br><h3>MARAUDER RANGER</h3>Fierce, fast, and hard-hitting, you are skilled at fighting with two weapons and using your off hand for throwing or parrying. Many of your attacks require thrown weapons. You're faster than other characters, but you're not interested in outrunning trouble; you go looking for it.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scything blow</i><br><br><h3>TWO-BLADE RANGER</h3>You like to get up close and rely on the ranger's famous two-weapon fighting style. Naturally, you prefer melee attack powers, and that means Strength should be your highest ability score. For your second ability, Dexterity is a good choice because it improves your AC. Make Wisdom your third choice, since it adds to your Will defense and provides a bonus to many of your powers. Choose powers that reflect your preference for fighting with two melee weapons.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Dungeoneering, Endurance, Heal, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>hit and run, twin strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>dire wolverine strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>jaws of the wolf</i><br><br><h3>RANGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Your class features depend largely on the build and fighting style you choose.<br><br><b>FIGHTING STYLE</b><br>Choose one of the following fighting styles and gain its benefit: Archer Fighting Style, Beast Mastery, Two-Blade Fighting Style, Marauder Fighting Style, Hunter Fighting Style.<br><br><b>Archer Fighting Style</b><br>Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat.<br><br><b>Beast Mastery</b><br>The Beast Mastery class feature is available to any ranger who wishes to gain a loyal beast companion. To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style.<br>You gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&amp;D world. You decide the creature's relevant details— its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.<br>    For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.<br>    You and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands.<br>    Beast Mastery also alters your Hunter's Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter's Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter's Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round.<br>    Your beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander's strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures.<br>    You can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn't a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends.<br>    As part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals.<br><br><b>Hunter Fighting Style</b><br>You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack.<br><br><b>Marauder Fighting Style</b><br>You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren't using a shield or a two-handed weapon.<br><br><b>Two-Blade Fighting Style</b><br>Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<br><br><b>HUNTER'S QUARRY</b><br>Once per turn, you can use your Hunter's Quarry power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Hunter's Quarry<span class=level>Hunter's Quarry Power</span></h1><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>  </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry.<br>Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level.

Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power.<br><br>As an assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse.<br><br>If others know that you are an assassin, you might find that few trust you. In some civilized realms, the study of shadow magic and assassination is banned on pain of death. In the past, and as a response to the outcry against them, assassins formed coteries, or guilds, of like-minded slayers, and each one delves into the study of shadow magic and develops unique methods of killing. A guild provides you with a measure of protection, and its grandmasters expect obedience and fealty. The wars between guilds, and the struggles within them, might never spill into mass battles, but they still leave dozens of slain folk in their wake.<br><br>As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ASSASSIN</h3>Assassins rely on Dexterity, Charisma, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but assassins typically choose powers that complement their choice of Guild Training.<br><h3>BLEAK DISCIPLE ASSASSIN</h3>You have studied the raw stuff of shadow and can use your abilities to manipulate and control the shadows cast by your enemies. At your command, shadows become physical objects that reach forth to grab and crush your foes, or hold them still while you ready a killing blow. Constitution should be your second highest ability score, after Dexterity. Charisma is a good third choice, to buoy your Will. Choose the Bleak Disciple option for your Guild Training class feature.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Bleak Disciple<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Shadow Veil Assassin<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>executioner's noose, leaping shade</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>nightmare shades</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>strangling shadow<br></i><br><br><h3>NIGHT STALKER ASSASSIN</h3>You tap into shadow magic to spread terror, cloud the reason of your enemies, drive away their allies, and leave all your foes vulnerable to your attack. After Dexterity, Charisma should be your second highest ability score. Constitution is a good third choice due to the additional hit points it grants. Choose the Night Stalker option for your Guild Training class feature, and focus on fear powers and powers that grant an additional benefit due to your Guild Training choice.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Night Stalker<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Nightmare Killer<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>inescapable blade, shadow storm</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>smothering shadow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>terrifying visage<br></i><br><br><h3>ASSASSIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Assassins have the following class features.<br><br><b>ASSASSIN'S SHROUD</b><br>You gain the assassin's shroud power. The dark magic of the Shadowfell courses through your veins, tainting your soul but granting you the ability to subject an enemy to invisible shrouds that reveal its weakest points. The more of your shrouds there are on a target, the deadlier a blow you can strike against it.<br><br><b>GUILD TRAINING</b><br>Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild.<br><br>Assassins' guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers' trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions.<br><br>Choose a method of training.

Add 2 to the temporary hit points gained at 11th level and 4 at 21st level.<br><br>Githyanki brought the tradition of the Bleak Disciple from the Astral Sea. It teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated.<br><br><b>Executioner's Guild</b><br>You gain the assassin's strike power.

This tradition teaches how best to draw on shadow magic to terrorize and deceive enemies.<br><br><b>SHADE FORM</b><br>You gain the shade form power. When you gave part of your soul to the Shadowfell, the power of that dark realm fused with your material form. As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid.<br><br>When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shade Form<span class=level>Assassin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You transform yourself into a being of shadow, becoming more difficult to notice and to harm.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn.

The shadow energy surrounding every creature touches the Shadowfell slightly, for the realm of death is a creature's eventual destination.

While you are in that form, even the most alert sentinel can overlook your approach, and attacks pass through you with little harm. When you spot your target, you study its weaknesses as you prepare to deliver a killing blow.<br><br>Religion: Assassins who pursue evil creatures are often worshipers of the Raven Queen, who teaches that death is the great leveler, a tool the world needs to end abuses by powerful beings. Evil assassins wallow in the misery and fear they cause, or they revel in performing an exquisite kill. Such folk usually venerate Zehir or Lolth.<br><br>Races: Revenants have the combination of implacability and physical ability needed to flourish as assassins. Half-orcs also excel as assassins, often having a brutish nature that makes the assassin's art palatable to them. Drow are superlative assassins, both because they grow up in a society that values skilled murder and because they are comfortable with working in darkness. Halflings make good assassins since they can combine their natural stealthiness with a native curiosity that makes hiding from them difficult. Changeling assassins possess an unsurpassed ability to infiltrate and kill from a position of trust.<br><br>Assassins and the Ki Focus<br>Assassins use ki focuses for the ability to augment mundane weapons. After all, a guard patrol is far more suspicious of the wanderer carrying a greatsword than of the unarmed peasant. Using ki focuses, assassins wield whatever weapons are at hand, or even unarmed strikes, to deliver shadow attacks.<br><br>When you use your ki focus with a weapon attack, you focus shadow magic into your weapon. Some assassins carry a few different weapons to ensure that they have the right tool for the job. An accurate weapon, such as a longsword, is a good tool for taking down a heavily armored warrior. When an assassin battles a brute that relies on endurance rather than defense, a less accurate but devastating weapon such as a greataxe proves useful.<br>    <br>Since your ki focus augments your basic attacks, a thrown weapon wielded in your off hand serves as the perfect complement to your primary weapon. You can throw a dagger to cut down a fleeing guard, and feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting improve your melee abilities.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Assassins focus their shadow energy through a ki focus, which is not an object they wield but a reservoir of magical power within themselves. When using a ki focus, an assassin taps into the power of shadow magic and channels it into both implement and weapon attacks.<br><br>You can imbue your ki focus with magic as if it were a physical implement. When you have a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.<br><br>You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. While wielding the weapon as an implement, the characteristics of the weapon you use—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties (such as defensive or high crit)—are irrelevant to your implement powers.<br><br>If you have a magic ki focus and wield a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of your ki focus or to employ the magic of your weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to attacks with that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the property of your magic weapon with the same attack power.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 16.</p>","class906":"<h1 class=player>Barbarian (Berserker)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender and Striker.

Life for these people is not easy, and it is made more difficult because fey crossings commonly appear in their lands. As children, tribe members are taught about the perils of crossing into the Feywild, and about the monsters that emerge from that realm with malicious intent. Faced with this constant danger, the barbarians continually fight to maintain their way of life.<br>    Some among them have fought so hard for so long that they know little other than violence as a means of protecting their tribes. These individuals, prone to rage that transforms them into whirling forces of destruction, are known as berserkers. Most berserkers are skilled warriors with keen survival instincts. When their ire is stoked, however, much of that experience and discipline is replaced by an animal fury unmatched among other warriors.<br>    If fury and aggressiveness was all that berserkers had to protect them from harm, they would eventually tire and be overcome by their enemies. When the berserkers' unbridled rage overtakes them, they become beacons of the spirit world, and their rage sounds like a gong calling to the primal spirits. Those spirits are drawn to such strong emotion, and are able to inhabit berserkers during their rages, protecting them against harm. The spirits also lend their energy to the berserkers, allowing them to perform incredible, even supernatural, feats.<br>    It is not just barbarians in the mortal world who become berserkers. Within the Feywild are many savage warriors, and that bright realm is a place where warriors who are as mercurial as the berserker fit right in. Many berserkers are found among the lycanthrope tribes of the Brokenstone Vale, others are among the elves who still dwell in the forests of the Feywild, and yet others can be found anywhere civilization has not yet encroached upon.<br><br><h3>BARBARIAN (BERSERKER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BERSERKER FURY</b><br>When you use a barbarian primal attack power, you enter your Berserker Fury until the end of the encounter.

They are capable of running with a wolf pack, speaking with the most ancient trees, and watching thunderstorms from atop the clouds themselves.

And though many druids project an outward calm, they have the cunning of the beast and the fury of the storm.<br>Whether you were born to the wilds or retreated from civilization, whether you chose your path or answered a call that whispered in your heart, you share a bond with the primal spirits of nature.

You can choose any powers you like, but many druids choose powers that complement their choice of Primal Aspect.<br><h3>GUARDIAN DRUID</h3>As a guardian druid, you are a protector of the land and those who rely on it. Yours is the magic of earth, forest, and sky, the enduring aspects of nature that outlive any mortal tyrant. Your powers incline you toward leader as a secondary role.

Swarm druids prefer to call on a particular primal force: insect swarms. Such druids see great strength in the unity of purpose and combined might of a colony of ants or a nest of hornets.<br><br>Most druids assume the forms of creatures such as bears, panthers, and rams, but a swarm druid splinters into hundreds of insects, all driven toward a single purpose by the druid's mind. The druid is at once all the creatures in the swarm and none of them. Enemies might stomp at the swarm, crushing a beetle here and swatting a wasp there, but to the druid the loss of an individual in the swarm means nothing. It is the swarm as a whole—a dauntless tide of chitin and stingers—that matters.<br><br>Swarm druids are most often found in tropical climates. They typically dwell in jungles, where they have witnessed the power of an ant colony on the march. Druids of the Underdark also tend toward this discipline. In web-shrouded caves, drow and troglodyte swarm druids commune with spiders, mushroom forests, and creatures that have never seen the light of day.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Swarm<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Toughness<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping claws, swarming locusts, thorn whip</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>scattered form</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fog of insects</i><br><br><h3>DRUID CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Druids have the following class features.<br><br><b>BALANCE OF NATURE</b><br>Some druids favor being in beast form, while others prefer being in humanoid form.

Throughout your career, at least one of those powers, and no more than two, must have the beast form keyword. By this means, you have access to useful attacks in either beast form or humanoid form.<br><br><b>PRIMAL ASPECT</b><br>Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world's noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids' visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers.<br>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Primal Guardian</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br><b>Primal Predator</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed.<br><br><b>Primal Swarm</b><br>While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you.

You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Wild Shape<span class=level>Druid Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your humanoid form.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa.

Scoundrels find success on the battlefield by using every trick at their disposal to deceive, mislead, and ambush their enemies. They draw on their many skills to give them an edge in combat, whether that edge enables them to snatch a treasure from a villain or leap away at the last moment to thwart an attack. Scoundrels are survivors, and they are not above getting their hands dirty to win the day.<br>    A scoundrel relies on clever planning and quick wits to survive. A thief focuses more broadly on acrobatics and unpredictable maneuvers. Scoundrels trade the thief 's reliable tricks for a broader, more unpredictable range of abilities. These martial powers, or exploits, mirror the scoundrel's preferred tactics and arise from a mix of training, improvisation, and skill. Some scoundrels favor punishing exploits, focusing on hitting hard and inflicting terrible injuries. Others use witty banter and feints to frustrate and misdirect opponents. Others still favor acrobatics, menace, or secrecy.<br>    Scoundrels are adventurers first and foremost. One might have learned the trade on the streets, might have developed his or her powers out of necessity after fate betrayed them, or could have been apprenticed to a master thief. Some scoundrels join adventuring parties for the promise of treasure and have few reservations about exploring dusty tombs and labyrinthine dungeons as long as there's a reward on the other side. Not all scoundrels are that mercenary, however. There are things other than loot that are worth fighting for.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ROGUE (SCOUNDREL)</h3><br><h3>AERIALIST ROGUE</h3>All rogues are known for their agility and daring, but you take both to the next level. Ducking under a giant's club isn't enough; you leap over it and cartwheel to safety. You're a masterful mover and an expert top-story burglar, using your abilities to tumble into the fray, into high openings, and out of all sorts of tight spots. Dexterity is your primary ability score, because you rely on it for your attacks and acrobatic stunts. Charisma is secondary for you, useful in avoiding opportunity attacks if you employ the Artful Dodger tactic. Strength serves you well as a tertiary ability, helping your Athletics checks in particular.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Defensive Mobility (Human feat: Sure Climber)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, riposte strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox's gambit</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>handspring assault</i><br><br><h3>BRAWNY ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deal plenty of damage, aided by your Strength, and also stun, immobilize, knock down, or push your foes. Your attacks use Dexterity, so keep that your highest ability score. Strength should be a close second—it increases your damage directly, and it can determine other effects of your attacks. Charisma is a good third ability score, particularly if you want to dabble in powers from the other rogue build. Select the brutal scoundrel rogue tactic, and look for powers that pack a lot of damage into every punch.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Toughness)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Dungeoneering, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>piercing strike, riposte strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>torturous strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>easy target</i><br><br><h3>CUTTHROAT ROGUE</h3>Leave smiles and misdirection to the tricksters. Instead, you use your animal magnetism in a more beastly way, oozing menace and implying a willingness to allow those who cross you to linger in pain. A friendly manner is for the weak; you achieve your way through tough words, hard looks, and the ability to back up either. Your attacks use Dexterity, so that should be your highest ability score. Charisma follows as a close second, essential for getting your way by using Intimidate. Strength comes in third; it's useful in delivering brutal attacks if you employ the Ruthless Ruffian tactic.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Press the Advantage (Human feat: Backstabber)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>disheartening strike, sly flourish</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>termination threat</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>checking jab</i><br><br><h3>SHADOWY ROGUE</h3>As your allies charge into battle, you hang back and take cover. While swords swing and spells explode, you carefully choose your target, line up your shot, and fire. The enemy staggers from your deadly attack, and by the time it has begun to look for you, you've vanished. You send death hurtling from your crossbow or sling, relentlessly assaulting your enemies. You pepper your foes with missiles, lending support to your allies without risking your own skin.<br>Shadowy rogues use powers that improve concealment and cover. Shadowy rogues want powers they can use from range, though it's a good idea to pick a few melee powers as well. Any powers that let you move as part of your attack are excellent choices, because they can help you become hidden using the Cunning Sneak class feature.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Cunning Sneak, Sharpshooter Talent<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Dungeoneering, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>gloaming cut, piercing strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>distracting shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scattering shot</i><br><br><h3>TRICKSTER ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deceive and misdirect your foes. You dart in and out of the fray in combat, dodging your enemies' attacks or redirecting them to other foes. Most of your attack powers rely on Dexterity, so that should be your best ability score. Charisma is important for a few attacks, for Charisma-based skills you sometimes use in place of attacks, and for other effects that depend on successful attacks, so make Charisma your second-best score. Strength is useful if you want to choose powers intended for the other rogue build. Select the artful dodger rogue tactic. Look for powers that take advantage of your high Charisma score, as well as those that add to your trickster nature.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Backstabber (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Bluff, Insight, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, sly flourish</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>positioning strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>trick strike</i><br><br><h3>ROGUE (SCOUNDREL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>All rogues share these class features.<br><br><b>FIRST STRIKE</b><br>At the start of every encounter, you have combat advantage against any creatures that have not yet acted in that encounter.<br><br><b>ROGUE TACTICS</b><br>You gain one of the benefits described below, depending on your choice of Rogue Tactics. Your choice also provides additional benefits to certain rogue powers, as detailed in those powers' descriptions.<br><br><b>Artful Dodger</b><br>You gain a bonus to AC against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier.<br><br><b>Brutal Scoundrel</b><br>You gain a bonus to Sneak Attack damage.

These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds.<br>    A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique.<br>    Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture's entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh.<br>    In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller.<br><br><h3>BARD (SKALD) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DECEPTIVE DUELIST</b><br>When you make a melee basic attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br><br><b>MASTER OF STORY AND SONG</b><br>You gain two 1st-level bard daily attack powers of your choice, but each day you can use only one bard daily attack power.<br>    When you gain a bard daily attack power at 5th level, you can use two bard daily attack powers per day, but no more than one of a particular level.

The greatest of the gods' mortal agents in that war were invokers, imbued with a fragment of the gods' own might to fight alongside them. No other mortal servant of the gods can claim the same kind of power. Through rites of investiture, avengers, clerics, and paladins gain the ability to manifest echoes of that power, uttering careful prayers and channeling divine energy through their holy symbols. You, however, channel your god's power directly. No mere symbol can contain it, for you speak the words of creation, shaping the universe to your and your god's will.<br><br>Perhaps you were trained in a secret monastery, or you studied in a library where the universe's oldest lore was preserved. Or perhaps you experienced the presence of your god firsthand and took a shard of divine power into yourself. You might even be an immortal born into flesh, slowly awakening to the awesome divine power that is your birthright. Whatever your past, you are among the gods' most trusted servants, bound to a covenant in which you swore to use divine power with great care. To what end will you wield that might?<br><br><h3>CREATING A INVOKER</h3>Invokers rely on Wisdom -- as an expression of their link to the divine will -- for the accuracy and potency of their attacks. Each invoker enters into a covenant with a god, a sworn pact in which the invoker agrees to fulfill certain duties in exchange for the divine power he or she will use to carry out those duties. The two most common covenants -- the Covenant of Preservation and the Covenant of Wrath -- lend themselves to two common invoker builds. Even though you must choose a covenant, you can choose any powers you like to help you fulfill it.<br><h3>MALEDICTION INVOKER</h3>The malediction invoker build is based on the Covenant of Malediction. The malediction invoker employs dread words of power to eradicate the gods' foes. These words of power come from the gods' lexicon, the very words of creation. The words are frequently too potent for mortals, imperiling the health and sanity of those who speak them. Malediction invokers need a high Wisdom score to intone the words properly and to piece together the inflections and holy grammar required to use the words in battle. Words of power bear a physical price, so malediction invokers should consider making Constitution their second highest ability, followed closely by Intelligence.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Malediction<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Baleful Malediction<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping shards, visions of blood</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>summons of justice</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>execration</i><br><br><h3>PRESERVING INVOKER</h3>You defend your allies, combining defensive magic with prayers that hinder or prevent your enemies' attacks. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence, since you need foresight and cunning to protect your allies. Choose powers that grant defensive benefits to your allies or penalties to your enemies. The preserving invoker leans toward leader as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Preservation<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Insightful Preservation<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>sun strike, vanguard's lightning</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>blades of astral fire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>binding invocation of chains</i><br><br><h3>WRATHFUL INVOKER</h3>You are an instrument of divine wrath, smiting those who have the temerity to doubt the reach of your god's power. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, since your physical durability allows you to withstand and channel divine wrath. Focus on powers that bring ruin to your foes. The wrathful invoker leans toward striker as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Wrath<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invoker Defense<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Insight, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>avenging light, grasping shards</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>thunder of judgment</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>purging flame</i><br><br><h3>INVOKER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Invokers have the following class features.<br><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>DIVINE COVENANT</b><br>Invokers wield ancient divine power that is not accessible to most mortals -- only to those who enter into a personal covenant with a god. Invokers undergo long years of study and testing. Only after that time are they allowed to enter into the final covenant that grants them access to this class's powers. Some say that, in the final swearing of the covenant, the invoker's god briefly manifests, but the details of an invoker's initiation are a closely held secret.<br>Choose one of the options described below. The Divine Covenant you choose provides you with a Channel Divinity power and a covenant manifestation that takes effect whenever you use a divine encounter or daily attack power. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain invoker powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Covenant of Malediction</b><br>The gods entrust you with the invocations of destruction used in their war against the primordials, so you can carry forward their sacred cause and ensure that the world's enemies never rise again.<br><br>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power maledictor's doom.<br><br>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can push one target hit by the power 1 square after the power's effect is resolved.<br><br><b>Covenant of Preservation</b><br>The gods have charged you to defend the faithful and to ally with those who seek to defeat the gods' enemies.<br>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power preserver's rebuke.<br>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can slide an ally within 10 squares of you 1 square.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Preserver's Rebuke<span class=level>Covenant of Preservation Power</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You call upon the gods to punish the enemy that dares harm those entrusted to your care.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Channel Divinity</b>: You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 10 squares of you hits your ally </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Before the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your next attack roll against the triggering enemy equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><br><br><b>Covenant of Wrath</b><br>You have sworn to seek out and destroy those that oppose the gods.

Most invokers devote themselves to a single deity, but all invokers recognize the entire pantheon as worthy of respect (see \"Deities,\" Player's Handbook, page 20). Whereas a cleric might revere Corellon and despise Lolth as a rival and enemy, an invoker dedicated to Corellon recognizes Lolth and her servants as comrades in arms against the forces that seek to destroy the world and the gods. That's not to say that you can't oppose the evil schemes of Lolth's followers if you're dedicated to Corellon, only that you shouldn't lose sight of the grander scheme of things.<br><br>Choice of Alignment: Invokers don't gain their power through rites of investiture or ordination, as avengers, clerics, and paladins do. You bear the touch of your god's own hand on your soul, a direct channel through which divine power can flow into the world, shaped by your will. Because you strive to bring your will into perfect accordance with your deity's, your alignment must match your deity's. For instance, an invoker of Moradin must be lawful good, an invoker of Pelor must be good, and an invoker of Ioun must be unaligned.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Invokers do not make use of holy symbols, since they believe that their magic predates and transcends such representations of divine power. Instead, invokers make use of rods and staffs as representations of the gods' dominion over the world. When you wield a magic rod or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of invoker powers and invoker paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 100.</p>","class147":"<h1 class=player>Shaman</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader.

You can choose any shaman powers you like for your character, though many shamans favor one of two different builds, letting their power choices be shaped by the form of their spirit companions.<br><h3>ANIMIST SHAMAN</h3>Although the world is no longer green and alive, primal spirits still haunt the land. Mesas, crags, dunes, salt pans, siroccos, sandstorms—all contain spirits just as the forests and the oases do.

The primal spirits you conjure exhibit the land's characteristics. A spirit might shed rain droplets, erupt in blazing fire, or stir one's hair as winds gust around it.

Through force of will, you compel the spirits, binding their power to your allies' attacks or directing them to loose their anger against your enemies.<br>    As an animist shaman, you command a spirit companion more elemental in nature than the spirit companions of other shamans. This elemental spirit might appear as a vortex of dust, a curtain of evaporating rain, a clattering gyre of pebbles, or any other desert phenomenon.<br>    You need Wisdom for your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next best score, because it helps boost the damage and benefits of your powers.

They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.<br>    However you came to your arcane knowledge, you need not accept the poor reputation warlocks sometimes endure. You could be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, you could be a true diabolist using your gifts to tyrannize the weak—some warlocks unfortunately are exactly that.<br>    The pacts are complete. The rites have concluded. The signs are drawn in blood, and the seals are broken. Your destiny beckons.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WARLOCK</h3>The two basic builds of warlock are the deceptive warlock and the scourge warlock. Warlocks rely on Charisma, Constitution, and Intelligence. No warlock powers or class features depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom.<br><h3>DECEPTIVE WARLOCK</h3>You prefer spells that deal a little less damage, but that inflict a variety of penalties and negative conditions on your foe. You'd rather fight at range and avoid getting caught in close-up battles. Most of your attack powers depend on Charisma, so that should be your best score. Many of your powers receive a bonus if you have a good Intelligence score, so that should be your second-best score. Constitution should be your third choice since you might want to choose some Constitution-based powers. You need it for a good Fortitude defense anyway.<br>    Deceptive warlocks should choose the fey pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Misty Step (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, eyebite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>witchfire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>curse of the dark dream</i><br><br><h3>SCOURGE WARLOCK</h3>No subtlety here—you want to deal damage. You're tougher than the deceptive warlock, and you've got powers to help you attack and defend in melee, as well as excellent ranged attacks. Your best attack powers depend on Constitution—make that your best ability score. Choose Intelligence second because it provides special bonuses to many of your powers and improves your Reflex defense and AC, too. Charisma is clearly your third choice.<br>    Scourge warlocks should choose the infernal pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Dark One's Blessing (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, History, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hellish rebuke</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>vampiric embrace</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flames of Phlegethos</i><br><br><h3>SORCERER-KING PACT</h3>On Athas, many templars swear an oath to a sorcerer-king in exchange for arcane power. The sorcerer-king pact reflects the training and magical transformations that a sorcerer-king might provide to an individual whom he or she deems worthy. A warlock who has this pact can draw on the reserves of power that a sorcerer-king commands.<br>    Most warlocks of this pact are templars in a sorcerer-king's service. They are often trusted members of the templar hierarchy who are expected to command the soldiers, the agents, or the underlings of a sorcerer-king. Thus, the powers of the sorcererking pact aid allies and work well in melee. A sorcerer-king sometimes imparts his or her power to a promising protégé or a privileged noble without making the recipient into a templar, although such instances are unusual.<br>    The sorcerer-kings desire servants who have great stamina and force of personality, so Charisma or Constitution should be the primary ability score for someone who has this pact. Intelligence is best as your secondary ability score, because many sorcerer-king pact powers gain a benefit from it. Charisma or Constitution, whichever you didn't pick as a primary score, is a good third choice. Choose Charisma to bolster your low Will defense if you plan to remain at range, or else use Constitution to gain extra hit points and healing surges if you intend to use your powers in melee combat.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Sorcerer-king pact<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Scornful Denial<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hand of blight</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>cruel bounty</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>ashen scourge</i><br><br><h3>WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELDRITCH BLAST</b><br>All warlocks know the eldritch blast at-will power.

Choose one pact. The pacts presented in the Player's Handbook are the fey pact, the infernal pact, and the star pact. Other products present additional pacts. The pact you choose determines the following warlock abilities:<br>    At-Will Spells: Your pact determines one of the at-will spells you know.<br>    Pact Boon: Each pact includes a pact boon. The pact boon is a granted power you can use to further hex your enemies.<br>    The pact you take also provides bonuses to certain warlock powers.

If this attack deals less than 12 damage, the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 0. If this attack deals 12 damage or more, you can cause the enemy to be weakened for its attack (which means the attack deals half damage), and the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 1.<br>    At 11th level, the damage you deal increases to 1d8 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value, and at 21st level the damage increases to 1d10 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. <br><h1 class=atwillpower>Darkspiral Aura<span class=level>Warlock Pact Boon 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your cursed enemies fall in battle, your Darkspiral Aura grows in power.

You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest.<br>Changing Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don't immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power.<br>After a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige.

You use powerful two-handed weapons to deal serious damage to your enemies.

They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For barbarians' foes, the moments of greatest terror come when barbarians call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals.<br>As a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors of your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers.<br>When the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake?<br><br><h3>CREATING A BARBARIAN</h3>You can choose any barbarian powers you like for your character, though many barbarians favor one of two builds: the rageblood barbarian or the thaneborn barbarian. All barbarians rely on Strength. Barbarians also benefit from a high Constitution or Charisma, depending on which expression of the class they favor.<br><h3>RAGEBLOOD BARBARIAN</h3>You can withstand a great deal of physical punishment, especially when you are in the throes of rage. At higher levels, your powers, particularly your rages, visibly manifest the spirits sacred to your tribe. Strength should be your highest ability score, since you use it for your attacks, but make Constitution a close second. Charisma might be your third-best score, especially if you want to use some powers designed for the thaneborn barbarian build. Rageblood barbarians lean toward defender as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Rageblood Vigor<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Expertise<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>devastating strike, recuperating strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>avalanche strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bloodhunt rage</i><br><br><h3>THANEBORN BARBARIAN</h3>You use primal power to fuel your mighty rages and lend power to your already imposing personal presence. Your combination of physical prowess and charismatic appeal draws allies to you as surely as it fills your foes with fear.

Whether you are raging or not, no one makes that mistake about you. Your ferocity and power have endeared you to the primal spirits of thunder. They circle around you, waiting for a time when you unleash them on your enemies.<br><br>When you stride into battle, low thunder rumbles around you. Even underground or on a clear day, the deep-throated murmur of distant storms accompanies you. When you charge, the growl grows into thunderclaps, sounding nearby.

Stories abound of the ability of such barbarians to cut down an entire group of bandits in the blink of an eye. These whirling barbarians combine supreme speed and agility with great strength.<br><br>Whirling barbarians fight with two weapons, often a pair of axes or swords. Dwarf whirling barbarians favor battleaxes and war picks, whereas half-orcs lean toward clubs and maces.<br><br>Compared to other barbarians, whirling barbarians are more mobile and better able to deal damage to several enemies with a single attack.

The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Rageblood Vigor</b><br>You gain the swift charge power.

In ages past, rangers kept the peace along the farthest frontiers of civilization, wandering the land to root out monsters and keep the roads clear of threats. Today, the empires of old are long gone, their roads fallen into ruin. Yet even as the encroaching darkness grows ever bolder, rangers continue the valiant fight to keep the borderlands safe and secure. So well do they perform this task that many of those on the frontier never realize the debt they owe to those who protect them.<br>    Many common folk are suspicious of rangers, knowing their kind only as loners who have no ties to kin or community. Indeed, some rangers eventually become little more than hermits watching over specific areas of the wild. However, as the darkness encroaches upon civilization, many rangers take on a protective role that prompts them to wander throughout all settled lands.<br>    A ranger's abilities reflect the divide between civilization and wilderness. Although rangers learn to master weapons, most commonly bows and those used in two-weapon fighting, they augment this martial training with their knowledge of primal magic. A ranger in the wild counts on his or her woodcraft and mastery of magic to survive.<br><br><h3>RANGER (HUNTER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ARCHERY STYLE</b><br>You gain one of the following features depending on your choice of ranged weapon.<br><br><b>Bow Hunter</b><br>You gain the Bow Expertise feat.<br><br><b>Crossbow Hunter</b><br>You gain the Crossbow Expertise feat.<br>    Also, if a crossbow you wield has the load minor property, you can instead reload it as a free action.<br><br><b>ASPECTS OF THE WILD (HUNTER)</b><br>You gain two of the following powers of your choice.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Aspect of the Cunning Fox<span class=level>Ranger Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Like a fox, you move with stealth, speed, and cunning.

If wizards wield magic as fighters wield swords, a sorcerer's magic is the arcing greataxe of a raging barbarian.<br>You might be a proud dragonborn scion of ancient Arkhosia, calling on the draconic power of your heritage, or perhaps you were bathed in dragon blood as an infant to fill you with that power. You might have been born in a place where planar forces converged in strange eddies, infusing you with chaos, or perhaps you survived implantation of a slaad embryo, which left the taint of chaos upon you.<br>Magic pulses through your veins, calling on you to give it expression. As it grows ever stronger, will it consume you or transform you into magic incarnate?<br><br><h3>CREATING A SORCERER</h3>Charisma, Dexterity, and Strength are the most important ability scores for a sorcerer. You can choose any powers you like, but many sorcerers choose feats, skills, and powers to complement their Spell Source choice.<br><h3>CHAOS SORCERER</h3>Like the arcane power you wield, you can be reckless and hard to control.

Choose either Dragon Magic or Wild Magic. The choice you make grants you specific features and also provides bonuses to certain sorcerer powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Cosmic Magic</b><br>The sun, the moon, and the stars speak to you in the voiceless language of cycles. The natural flow of the seasons tugs at your blood as the tide acts upon the oceans, pushing and pulling with gentle insistence regardless of the storm's fury, the dragon's flight, or the antics of otherworldly primordials. Just as the constellations move around the sky in a steady, imperturbable cadence, your spells are strong and unshakable, and tied to energies that can outlast all others.<br><b>Cosmic Persistence</b>: While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br><b>Cosmic Power</b>: You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Strength modifier.

Like a tempest, you never give up and never give in until you are completely spent.<br><b>Storm Power</b>: You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Dexterity modifier. The bonus equals your Dexterity modifier + 2 at 11th level and your Dexterity modifier + 4 at 21st level.<br><br><b>Storm Soul</b>: You gain resist 5 thunder and resist 5 lightning. This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level.<br>While this resistance is active, your arcane powers ignore all targets' resistance to that damage type up to the value of your resistance.<br>If you are hit by an attack, you can end this resistance as an immediate interrupt to gain a +4 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. If you do so, the resistance returns after you take a short rest or an extended rest.<br><br><b>Storm's Embrace</b>: When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll for an arcane power, wind surges around you and your enemy.

However, more of your powers create bursts or blasts of elemental forces to damage multiple foes, and your magic is the result of powerful arcane forces in your blood rather than the result of pacts you have made with mysterious entities.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Sorcerers wield daggers and staffs to channel their wild arcane power. When you wield a magic dagger or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<br>    Any dagger can function as a sorcerer implement.

Marshals draw from their experience and passion to lend courage, skill, and hope to those under their command. A warlord forms the iron core of any unit of soldiers, uniting their purpose and bolstering their commitment to see the conflict to its conclusion.<br>    A marshal's talents can come from many different aspects of personality or endeavor. Some depend on their bravado, goading their companions to take risks in order to reap great rewards. Others have keen insight into their enemies' minds. Some marshals specialize in hit-and-run tactics, and others are resourceful leaders who always have some trick up their sleeves. The most common marshals include those whose presence alone is enough to bind disparate heroes together and the tactical savants who spot weaknesses and exploit them.<br>    Marshals develop specialized combat maneuvers called exploits. In their elementary form, they are strikes and commands designed to shift the battle toward a more favorable outcome. In addition to these exploits, marshals issue commands and orders that improve their allies' performance. Some of these commands can restore health and vigor, while others make allies more alert and ready for new challenges.<br>    Most marshals have already had experience in the field, even if it came from leading a tiny expedition. Some are former military leaders who have relinquished their commands to seek their fortunes in the world. Others might have lost their units and be out for revenge against the enemy that brought them to ruin. Whatever the individual's triumphs or defeats were before becoming an adventurer, every marshal has the ability to lead, and lead well.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WARLORD (MARSHAL)</h3><br><h3>BRAVURA WARLORD</h3>You lead through a combination of daring attacks and aggressive tactics. Using your powers is risky, but the rewards for success are great. You help your allies find the nerve to profit from bold maneuvers and punch into enemies head-on. Compared to other warlords, you're oriented more toward handling heavy fighting yourself, and your attack powers rely mainly on Strength. Charisma is your second priority, for it lets you get away with your audacious stunts yet maintain the respect of your comrades. Mental acuity and quick reflexes in battle are valuable to any warlord, so Intelligence is also important to you. The Bravura Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Bravura (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>brash assault, furious smash</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>luring focus</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fearless rescue</i><br><br><h3>INSIGHTFUL WARLORD</h3>You lead through careful observation and a knack for predicting your enemies' actions. In combat, you keep your eyes open and quickly adapt your plan to changing circumstances. You show your allies how to identify enemy weaknesses and exploit those flaws. You are skilled at demoralizing foes and are an expert at interrupting their actions by issuing quick commands.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Insightful Presence, Canny Leader<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lend Strength<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>direct the strike, intuitive strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>powerful warning</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>leader's instincts</i><br><br><h3>INSPIRING WARLORD</h3>You lead by exhortation, encouragement, and inspiration. Your powers help your allies find new surges of courage and endurance within themselves, helping them heal, shrug off debilitating conditions, and defend themselves from attack. Your attack powers rely on Strength, so that should be your best ability score. The benefits you give your allies, though, depend almost entirely on Charisma, so make that second best. Intelligence is your best third choice, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to help your Reflex defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Charisma score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Inspired Recovery (Human feat: Toughness)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Heal, History<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander's strike, furious smash</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>guarding attack</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bastion of defense</i><br><br><h3>RESOURCEFUL WARLORD</h3>You don't limit yourself to a particular set of tactics, instead adapting to the mistakes and openings your enemies provide and endeavoring to create opportunities. You lead through a diverse selection of shouted commands, ongoing stratagems, martial stances, and flexible plans. Allies can expect help in a wide variety of circumstances. As is typical for a warlord, Strength is your primary ability, but your powers make use of Intelligence and Charisma, encouraging you to pick and choose among the powers that other traditions have to offer. The Resourceful Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Resources (Human feat: Durable)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander's strike, opening shove</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>hammer formation</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>calculated assault</i><br><br><h3>SKIRMISHING WARLORD</h3>You scoff at the notion that war takes place on the front lines. Your talents are akin to the skills of archers, sneaks, and scouts. You recognize that their contributions are as vital as the efforts of melee combatants. You help allies by sharpening their timing, directing their maneuvers, and pointing out targets with your own ranged attacks.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Archer Warlord, Skirmishing Presence<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Archer Captain<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Diplomacy, History<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>paint the bull's eye, risky shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>race the arrow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>inspiring shot</i><br><br><h3>TACTICAL WARLORD</h3>Your leadership takes the form of quick commands, cunning strategies, and tactical superiority. Your powers guide your allies to extra and more powerful attacks, as well as helping them move quickly in combat situations. You also assist your allies by moving your enemies around or knocking them prone. You use Strength for your attack powers, so make that your best ability score. Intelligence is secondary, because your Intelligence determines just how effective a leader you are. Charisma should be your third best score, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to improve your Will defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Intelligence score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Tactical Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>viper's strike, wolf pack tactics</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>warlord's favor</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>lead the attack</i><br><br><h3>WARLORD (MARSHAL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>All warlords have these class features.<br><br><b>ARCHER WARLORD</b><br>When you choose the Archer Warlord class feature, you lose proficiency with chainmail and light shields.<br>You gain proficiency with military ranged weapons. In addition, when you make a ranged basic attack with a bow, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br><br><b>BATTLEFRONT LEADER</b><br>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br>    You gain proficiency with heavy shields, and you gain the battlefront shift power.<br><br><b>CANNY LEADER</b><br>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br>    You and any ally within 10 squares of you who can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br><br><b>COMBAT LEADER</b><br>You and each ally within 10 squares who can see and hear you gain a +2 power bonus to initiative.<br><br><b>COMMANDING PRESENCE</b><br>Choose one of the following presence benefits below.<br>The choice you make also provides bonuses to certain warlord powers.

If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn.<br><br><b>Insightful Presence</b><br>When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the start of his or her next turn.<br><br><b>Inspiring Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br>    If the ally can see multiple warlord allies who have this class feature, the ally regains hit points from only one of them (the ally's choice).<br><br><b>Resourceful Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br><b>Skirmishing Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack.<br><br><b>Tactical Presence</b><br>When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the first attack roll of that attack. The bonus equals half your Intelligence modifier.<br>    If multiple warlord allies who have this class feature can see the ally, he or she gains the bonus from only one of them (the ally's choice).<br><br><b>INSPIRING WORD</b><br>Using the inspiring word power, warlords can grant their comrades additional resilience with nothing more than a shout of encouragement.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Inspiring Word<span class=level>Warlord Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You call out to a wounded ally and offer inspiring words of courage and determination that invigorates your comrade.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.

In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known—seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven.<br>    Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches—the original voice from the darkness—is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous.<br>    The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen.<br>    Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (WITCH) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>AUGURY</b><br>You gain the augury power.<br><br><h1 class=dailypower>Augury<span class=level>Wizard Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You read the mystic signs and glean a notion of the future.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must use this power during an extended rest.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You ask a question and receive a vague notion of the future.

Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.<br><br>Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies' minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ARDENT</h3>Ardents depend on Charisma more than other abilities. Constitution is important for powers that improve your allies' attacks, and Wisdom is important if you want to foil your enemies' attacks. You can choose any powers you like, though many ardents favor one of the two builds described here.<br><h3>ENLIGHTENED ARDENT</h3>You read your enemies' weaknesses and reveal them to your allies, and your keen insight helps your allies overcome damaging effects. Make Charisma your highest ability score. You should also consider investing in Wisdom to take advantage of powers that confuse your enemies. Your secondary role is defender, and your leadership helps protect allies from harm.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Clarity<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Bolstering Mantle<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>focusing strike, psionic shield</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Clarity<br>Feat: Bolstering Mantle<br>Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: focusing strike, psionic shield<br>Daily Power: wormhole plunge</i><br><br><h3>EUPHORIC ARDENT</h3>You can scarcely contain the emotions that strain against your will like a crashing tide. When you make your attacks, they flood out of you, increasing your allies' confidence and washing away your enemies' courage. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by a high Constitution score to improve those effects that raise your allies' spirits and diminish your enemies' capabilities. If you want to diversify your powers, a high Wisdom can't hurt, but you should also look to Dexterity for initiative checks and Reflex. Your secondary role is striker, and your powers can augment your allies' attacks.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Elation<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Heartening Surge<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demoralizing strike, ire strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Elation<br>Feat: Heartening Surge<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>At-Will Powers: demoralizing strike, ire strike<br>Daily Power: battleborn acuity</i><br><br><h3>IMPETUOUS ARDENT</h3>Impetuous ardents have little use for caution or careful planning, and they allow their natural talent and fate to guide their actions. As an impetuous ardent, your secondary role is striker. Choose powers that deliver punishing damage, improve your allies' attacks, or strip away your enemies' ability to protect themselves. Any power that can help to quickly remove an enemy's threat reinforces your preferred tactics. This said, wading through enemies places you at great risk. To mitigate the dangers arrayed against you, be sure to invest in feats and powers that help you last in combat.<br>    Charisma should be your highest ability score. Look to your Dexterity score next to let you act sooner in the round and to keep your Reflex high.

You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br>    <br>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br>    <br>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br>    <br>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 22.</p>","class129":"<h1 class=player>Avenger</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker.

Primeval forests sit untouched by civilization since their creation, alongside mountainsides and hilltops upon which no intelligent being has ever set foot. It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane.<br>    As with all druids, protectors are the masters of the magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane.<br>    As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by the primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.<br>    You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic. Though you will stray far from your druid circle in the course of your adventures, your efforts reflect on its goals, and you will use the knowledge it has granted you to battle despoilers and defilers throughout the world and across the planes.<br><br><h3>DRUID (PROTECTOR) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DRUID CIRCLE</b><br>Choose a druid circle.

Rather than bind themselves to a particular school, as mages do, arcanists experiment with a wide range of magical effects from evocation to necromancy and everything in between. Considered dilettantes by their mage counterparts, arcanists see diverse study as a boon because it broadens their ability to deal with a variety of situations, by always having the proper spell on hand.<br>    The arcanist is a generalist and a theorist. This path of arcane study focuses more on a broader understanding of principles instead of specific techniques relating to schools. To an arcanist, how he or she casts a spell is far more important than what sort of spell is used. Many arcanists follow their imagination as to what spells they might learn and which they might use on any given day, rather than adhering to the dictates of academia.<br>    Like mages, arcanists gravitate to the adventuring life because it gives them the chance to discover interesting new spells and rituals to add to their spellbooks. Though they might lack focus, arcanists prove themselves equal to their schoolspecialist counterparts in both learning ability and application of that knowledge, and are counted as valued members of any expedition.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WIZARD (ARCANIST)</h3><br><h3>CONTROL WIZARD</h3>Your favorite powers restrict your enemies in various ways—crushing them in the coils of a lightning serpent, trapping them in a cloud of noxious vapor, or encasing them in ice. Intelligence drives your attack powers, so make it your highest ability score. Wisdom can help you maintain control over your enemies if you choose the orb of imposition form of Implement Mastery, so it should be your second-best score. Make Dexterity your third best score. Putting a good score in Constitution can help you stay alive by increasing your hit points and healing surges, as well as contributing to your Fortitude defense. If you choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, your Constitution can also help your other defenses. Select powers that help you control the battlefield and make the best use of your high Wisdom score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Initiative (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, Insight, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>cloud of daggers, thunderwave</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>icy terrain</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>sleep</i><br><br><h3>ILLUSIONIST WIZARD</h3>Your mysterious powers cloud the mind and assault the senses. The imaginary landscapes and phantasmal creatures you create impede, distract, and redirect your foes. Nothing is what it seems when you're in control.<br>    Intelligence should be your highest ability score, since it governs your attack powers. A high Charisma score lets you enhance some illusion effects. Choose powers that have the illusion keyword, and take the Orb of Deception form of Arcane Implement Mastery to get the most out of them.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Orb of Deception<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Phantom Echoes<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, Dungeoneering, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>illusory ambush, phantom bolt</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>grasping shadows</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>horrid whispers</i><br><br><h3>SUMMONER WIZARD</h3>Terrifying creatures obey your call, and you order them to aid you and to fight for you. In addition to binding these monsters, you are skilled at conjuring objects made of magical energy to impede or harm your foes. You must use your own actions to control your summoned monsters, so your role in combat is quite different from that of other wizards.<br>    As with other wizards, a high Intelligence score is crucial to attack rolls and damage rolls. Your summoned creatures' hit points depend on your own, and many conjuration spells deal additional damage or have improved effects that depend on Constitution, so make that your second-highest score. Use the Tome of Binding form of Arcane Implement Mastery, since it improves your summoning spells. Select daily powers that have the summoning keyword, and encounter and at-will powers that have the conjuration keyword.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Tome of Binding<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Careful Summoner<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>scorching burst, storm pillar</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>astral wasp</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>summon fire warrior</i><br><br><h3>WAR WIZARD</h3>Your delight is in powers that deal damage—lots of damage, to many foes at a time. Enormous bursts of fire, searing bolts of lightning, and waves of caustic acid are your weapons. Intelligence is your most important ability score. Dexterity should be your second-best score, and it is important if you choose the wand of accuracy form of Implement Mastery. Make Wisdom your third-best score. You might instead choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, which lets your Constitution aid your defenses against some attacks. Even if you don't, Constitution increases your hit points, healing surges, and Fortitude defense.

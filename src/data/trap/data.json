Furthermore, a creature that starts its turn in a square of wrath mud and does not make a melee attack before the end of its turn takes 5 psychic damage per tier.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Wrath mud is similar to, but more unforgiving than, blood rock. It is typically used to create bottlenecks that force bloody melee battles—the kind of fight that demons enjoy most.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in The Plane Below, page(s) 17.</p>","trap952":"<h1 class=thHead>Concealed Pit<br><span class=thLevel>Level 1 Trap<span class=thXP>XP 0</span></span></h1><p class=thStat><b>Detect</b> Perception DC 12</p><span class=thInit><b>Initiative</b> -</span><p class=thStat><b>Immune</b> attacks </p><h2 class=thHead>Triggered Actions</h2><p class=th2>⚔ <b>Attack</b> ✦ <b>At-Will</b></p><p class=tbod><i>Trigger</i>: A Medium or smaller creature enters a pit square.</p><p class=tbod><i>Attack</i> (<i>Immediate Reaction</i>): Melee 1 (triggering creature); +4 vs. Reflex</p><p class=tbod><i>Hit</i>: The target falls 2 squares (10 feet) into the pit, taking 1d10 falling damage, and is knocked prone.

Other portals will set the destination randomly.<br>    A portal can also malfunction. The most common malfunction is an unintended or random destination. Some malfunctioning portals have strange effects.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>A great way to change up an adventure from what is expected is to use a malfunctioning portal, just don't introduce one too often or the players will avoid all portals, or examine each one to make sure it's safe. If the group believes they are going to one location and prepare for that destination, send them to another completely different location they aren't prepared for (for example, if they are prepared to go to the Hells, send them to an icy world in the Astral Sea. Give them a way back, however, if you don't want the story to change course for an extended period.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 54.</p>","terrain74":"<h1 class=dm>Psychic Reservoir</h1><p class=flavor>Sheltered from the blowing grit, odd violet crystals grow in caverns or rocky terrain.

When a fey creature dies, it is placed in a mound and covered loosely with earth, branches, and leaves. Mushrooms grow around such mounds, and lights, ghostly giggling, and fey apparitions are common near or on them. Powerful magical treasures, the former belongings of the dead fey, are often placed in the mound.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>A nearby creature that makes a DC 27 Arcana check can sense a fey mound. Fey mound soil is a powerful component in fertility rituals. Some mounds act as fey crossroads. Most are trapped, and some are guarded by living fey. Those guardians gain a +1 bonus to any one d20 roll they make each round while guarding the mound.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Use a fey mound's strange phenomena (strange lights, calling voices) to draw the characters into the area of a fey mound. Have the buried fey creature's spirit rise to confront the characters. Depending on their interaction, the spirit either imparts useful knowledge or its former belongings, or turns into a vengeful spirit, such as a banshee, and attacks the characters for disturbing the burial site.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 53.</p>","terrain15":"<h1 class=dm>Healing Ground</h1><p class=flavor>This area is infused with primal energy that allows life of all sorts to flourish.

Also called an arch of wonder, a mushroom arch appears as a series of glowing mushrooms (frequently pale purple) that grow together to form an arch over a corridor through which a creature can pass.<br>    A mushroom arch can form over a tunnel of any size up to 4 squares in width or height. It can be identified with a DC 20 Arcana or Dungeoneering check.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>A mushroom arch gives off dim light in a 5-square radius. It also can affect creatures that pass through it, but rarely the same way twice. The effect is sometimes negligible, other times positive, and occasionally awful.<br>    A creature that walks through a mushroom arch (or moves to stand directly beneath it) is affected automatically; roll a d10 and refer to the table below to determine the effect. A fey creature that walks through a mushroom arch adds 2 to the roll.

If you choose not to reveal the terrain's effect immediately, use visual clues to help the players understand the terrain effect.<br>    Adding a pillar of life to an encounter will also let you set the characters against a much more difficult encounter, since they will gain the extra healing. As an alternative to reduce the pillar's effectiveness slightly, consider having the pillar only work ever other round, to create a “capture the flag” type of environment between the characters and their opposition (with visual, auditory, or some other clue indicating when it's powered up).</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 68.</p>","terrain75":"<h1 class=dm>Rocky Badlands</h1><p class=flavor>The canyons and wastes of Athas's rocky badlands are rugged and arid.

These magic weapons are made from the ritually enlarged evil eyes of deceased fomorian rulers and champions. Nourished by the blood of wounded foes (see “Blood Grate,”), they remain alive and vigilant, loosing beams of arcane energy at invaders.<br>    Each eye unblinking occupies a single square, set high in a tower. A typical fortress has one to four eyes unblinking, depending on its size. A fortress with insufficient eyes unblinking to cover all approaches rarely lasts long in the Feydark. An eye unblinking can be identified with a DC 25 Arcana check.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>Once per encounter on its turn, each eye unblinking can create a particular special effect as an area burst 5 within 20 squares of the tower in which the eye is set. The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. Once an eye unblinking creates its zone, it can move the zone 3 squares on its initiative count (initiative +11). Consider an eye to have a Will of 18 for the purpose of attempts to dispel its magic.<br>    Included here are three examples of special effects; feel free to create your own minor effect along these lines. All such effects are designed only to assist those loyal to the ruler of the tower.<br>    ✦     No fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone grants combat advantage.<br>    ✦     Each fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone gains resist 5 to a particular type of damage (such as acid or fire).<br>    ✦     When a fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone hits an enemy with a melee attack, it can shift 1 square as a free action.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Place eyes unblinking to drive home the difficulty of assaulting the fomorians on their home territory.

The visions and memories are usually random and nonsensical, but sometimes they can impart information.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Use pools of divine blood to create a feel of ancient, immense divine power. Play up the memories and visions of gods fighting primordials. Include just one square of divine blood with monsters that have forced movement powers to create a “capture the flag” feel to the encounter as the characters' enemies try to position themselves on the divine blood square to gain temporary hit points. Or add multiple blood squares to give the characters the option of retreating to one for its temporary hit point benefit. Including a lurker that targets characters seeking one of those squares will make such an encounter more interesting.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 22.</p>","terrain42":"<h1 class=dm>Elemental Spout</h1><p class=flavor>Eruptions of material or elemental energy are a common occurrence in the Plane Below. Any substance can issue forth from solid surfaces, bodies of liquid, raging storms, or empty air.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>An elemental spout fills a burst, 1 square per tier, centered on a particular origin square. The spout might erupt at intervals or when a creature moves within 1 square of the burst's center. For interval eruptions, the spout rolls initiative at the start of combat or takes effect at a specific time in a round; for an erratic spout, you might roll initiative each round.<br>    The effect of an elemental spout depends on the type of energy or material it disgorges. A summary of common elemental spouts and their effects follows. Exotic spouts also exist that contain more than one substance.<br>    Acid: 5 acid damage per tier, and ongoing 5 acid damage per tier (save ends).<br>    Frost: 5 cold damage per tier, and the target is slowed (save ends).<br>    Lightning: 5 lightning damage per tier, and the target is dazed (save ends).

Whenever a creature in that space takes damage, each other creature in the space takes 5 psychic damage per tier. If no other creature is in the agony amplifier, the triggering creature takes 5 extra psychic damage per tier.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>An agony amplifier is most likely to be found in a dark priest's temple or wizard's lair. These circles are useful for convincing fiendish creatures to serve the binder that called them. They can also be used effectively by creatures that immobilize or restrain.

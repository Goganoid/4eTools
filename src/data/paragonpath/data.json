The deeds and exploits of those conflicts resound still in epic story and song. One such anthem is Lament of the Dreadnought, a somber song that recounts the final march of Jagannash the Unstoppable, a great dragonborn hero.<br>    A doughty warrior famed for his ability to fight on no matter the injuries he sustained, Jagannash accumulated a number of legends. He withstood the full fury of an angry blue dragon, shrugged off the lashes of a pit fiend's whip, and even killed a tiefling warlock who had hurled him through Hell. The Lament, though, speaks of his final battle and all he achieved in the last offensive against the tiefling empire. Jagan nash felled a full legion of devils, strangled their succubus sorceress commander with his bare hands, and hammered his way through the walls of a fortress. He was climbing the tower that housed the tiefling war room when the earth rebelled and swallowed the citadel and all within it. It is whispered that Jagannash fights there still, despite the centuries. Such is his resilience.<br>    It is from Jagannash's example that other fighters who follow a similar creed take inspiration. The mind– body practices of these warriors are kept and taught by a few masters, dragonborn and otherwise. Some even develop these talents without formal training. <br>    As a dreadnought, you are an inexorable force of destruction. You turn aside weapons with nothing more than your force of will.

It was the first weapon ever made, and it and its variants are still the most common arms in use. Simple spears are designed heavy for melee or light for throwing. A melee spear can be used with one hand or two. Specialized variations of the spear such as the longspear, the tratnyr, and various polearms were specifically designed for war. Such weapons provide a huge boon in the form of reach, allowing a wielder to strike from <br>relative safety and to control the melee. Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose.<br>    Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance. With a single spear, a warrior can choose to fight with a shield or without. Longspears and polearms allow an officer to contribute to combat while leading frombehind the front line, where the clash can be better observed and directed.<br>    Cognizant of the benefits of the spear, you chose to specialize in this multifaceted weapon. You trained to make long lunges and quick jabs with your weapon. A spear's haft is a defensive tool for you, and you have learned how to hedge in your foes or open deep wounds.

But not all techniques evolve from the teachings of these paragons of the warrior's art. Some methods come from origins far less noble. The path of the dread reaper is one such shadowy road.<br>    According to legend, the first dread reaper was Gulkanon, a human paladin of the Raven Queen, stripped of his station and power for offending his god. Even without the connection to the deity he had long revered, Gulkanon was unwilling to surrender his place as her champion. He turned to a new avenue of military study, building upon the techniques of savage and fell races in the world—orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls. He took the crude strokes of these brutish creatures and refined them, developing a range of exploits that focused his strength into a vehicle of appalling carnage. As he grew more confident in his newfound skills, he took the title “dread reaper.” He set out to send souls to his estranged patron in hopes of rekindling the bond that had been broken. Whether he succeeded is lost to time, but his legacy remains.<br>    Some dread reapers serve the Raven Queen, and small cults of such warriors can be found who are willing to train promising candidates. Others who have this training, however, lack the will or discipline to find true favor with the god. A few stretch her tenets to accommodate their own excesses. The Raven Queen's vigilant servants have been known to hunt and slay the worst of those offenders.<br>    Whether you had an affinity for death-dealing or found inspiration in the actions of another, you turned to the techniques of the dread reaper. The training offers you a special array of fighting maneuvers that emphasize your already impressive proficiency with two-handed weapons. Your training transformed you from a competent warrior to a terrifying force of destruction. Rather than minding your defenses, you favor wreaking havoc in combat. Enemies can't help but notice your destructive potential and ignore you at their peril. You can perform astonishing attacks, sweeping through your foes and laying them open with your steel.<br><br><h3>DREAD REAPER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Impending Slaughter (11th level)</b>: If your opportunity attack bloodies an enemy marked by you, you can knock the enemy prone.<br>    <b>Reaper's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack with a two-handed weapon, each enemy adjacent to you takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.<br>    <b>Reaping Cleave (16th level)</b>: When you hit with a melee basic attack using a two-handed weapon, an enemy adjacent to you takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

With my sword, it whispers of your defeat.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter<br><br>Storied history follows the shield, a warrior's best friend and an implement of honor and identity in a fighter's panoply. A stout shield can turn aside mundane swords and arrows, as well as monstrous venom sprays and dragon fire. Only a steadfast ally is better for covering the flank while you're taking it to the enemy. Nothing is better to protect that ally.<br>    Throughout time, the use of the shield has defined military tactics. In phalanx formations, common among many folk, one soldier stands alongside another, each relying on a comrade's shield for added protection. During a charge, a shield aids in pushing the enemy back or even down. Warriors in a unit of skilled shield bearers can place their shields together in an overarching arrangement, completely protecting all within the shield shell from outside attack. This is said to have originally been a dwarven trick, a “boulder formation.”<br>    The Arkhosian warrior-philosopher Khomagar said, “The shield is the law of the battlefield, protecting the soldier as lordly and righteous edicts protect the empire.” Phalanx fighters from many cultures suffer dishonor or worse for losing their shields in battle, since such a loss weakens the unit as a whole. Numerous peoples maintain a tradition of bringing dead warriors home on their shields, and burying a shield with its owner. Especially among dwarves, a broken shield is seen as a symbol of loss or corruption.<br>    The shield is even more important to a small-unit fighter who relies upon it to protect his or her few allies. To the wise soldier who fulfills such duties, a shield is as much a weapon as a defensive item.<br>    You know these facts well.

Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment.<br>    Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild's nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal.<br>    Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life. Each eladrin learns to wield the longsword, the traditional weapon of the eladrin people. They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements.<br>    A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty. The metal vibrates with bizarre potential. Some eladrin learn to make steel shaped into such a blade sing its heart's song. That song is a fey cry that portends loss of life, and those who wield it are known across the cosmos as blade banshees.<br>    Over the years, you've developed a terrifying synergy with your blades. You understand the secret heart of fey-crafted steel. Its unmistakable, dread voice announces your displeasure.

They come in many different forms from place to place—long files of slave porters, pack trains of heavily laden crodlus and kanks, wagons drawn by snorting inixes, and of course the towering mekillot-drawn argosy wagons that are wooden fortresses on wheels. Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.<br>    Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat. Disaster in a hundred guises waits in the desert—hungry monsters, savage raiders, ruthless competitors, scourging sandstorms, unreliable wells, mutinous drivers, and the possibility that the goods turn out to be worth less than one paid for them when they reach market. From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling.

Demon, obey!\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane class<br><br>You have nothing to fear from things you control. It's the things you can't control that can ruin you. As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.<br>    You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss.     <br>    As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.<br><br><h3>DEMONOLOGIST PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Demonic Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature adjacent to you takes 5 damage of the chosen type, and you gain resist 10 to that type until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Demonic Companion (11th level)</b>: You gain a quasit companion. The quasit is a creature allied with you, but not with your allies.<br>    You can communicate telepathically with the quasit as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so.<br>    Your quasit's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.<br>    The quasit shares your healing surges. Whenever an effect requires your quasit to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. When you use your second wind, your quasit also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your quasit regains all its hit points.<br>    If you die or your quasit drops below 1 hit point, it disappears. You have two ways of calling your quasit back.<br>    ✦     Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with hit points equal to your healing surge value.<br>    ✦     Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of the rest. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with full hit points.<br><br>Quasit Actions<br>As a creature under your control, your quasit relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.     <br>    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your quasit needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your quasit can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your quasit to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your quasit needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your quasit can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: The quasit can take a triggered action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your quasit companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command the quasit to make the attack.<br>    Quasit Independent Actions: Your quasit serves you against its will. If you are in a situation where you can't give the quasit commands, such as when you are unconscious, stunned, dominated, or more than 20 squares away from it, it acts under the Dungeon Master's control as your enemy. When you can issue commands again, the quasit comes under your control once more.<br>    A quasit acting independently can take a standard, a move, and a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but cannot take immediate actions. <br>    <b>Demonic Summons (16th level)</b>: Your quasit companion and any creatures you summon gain a +2 power bonus to damage rolls.

For the organized and resourceful, there's always an angle.<br>    Thieves' guilds are criminal gangs that crop up mostly in urban areas. A single guild might manage or influence illegal activities such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, espionage, fencing stolen goods, grifting, smuggling, loan sharking, pickpocketing, piracy, racketeering, robbery, thuggery, and so on. A guild might also direct legal enterprises as legitimate business ventures, as cover, or as a way to control the flow of information. For instance, many thieves' guilds have their fingers in begging, bounty hunting, mercenary work, gambling, prostitution, shipping, and even street cleaning and lamp lighting.<br>    Because a guild's business can be so varied, and because it often has trouble with legal authorities and rival gangs, it must divide its profitable interests between various centers of control. Those centers have bosses, who report to those higher in the chain of command. Thus, guilds have complicated hierarchies, clear divisions of authority, and codes of behavior that can border on downright law-abiding in some respects. A guildmaster typically leads a portion of a guild, and some guilds have a grand master who oversees a guild's entire operation.<br>    You might be an actual guildmaster, or maybe you grew up in the criminal world and know what's what on the street and in a brawl.

In numerous places, the land, sky, and sea roil in a never-ending clash of lightning and fire, poison gas and rolling earth, biting water and tearing wind. The chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no leader exerts control. Where one element dominates, the will of a mighty force of nature is often what makes it so.<br>    The unrestrained chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no skilled leader exerts control. In such a combat zone, forces clash without clear direction. The tide of battle is all too often determined merely by fate. Clear advantage on one side or the other can rarely be overcome. One side overwhelms the other by happenstance or because of uneven odds. Victory is won at too heavy a cost.<br>    A mythological genasi general of the ancient world, Vyn-kazi, knew the price of warfare's chaos all too well. She had witnessed it. Like the entropic realm from which they sprang, the great Primordials warred with the gods with no common purpose and no organization—no plan at all. Most of these mighty beings were fractious and grasping loners with armies of fierce slaves. They all but allowed the gods to coordinate against them. One by one, each and its armies succumbed to the gods and their legions.<br>    Vyn-kazi survived a disastrous battle in which her master, Nekal of the Glowing Deep, fell against a host that included Pelor, Kord, Bane, Ioun, and Sehanine. The watersoul genasi went on to swear fealty to Pelor and to take on a firesoul aspect in his name. She then led her people against other Primordials in service to the god of the sun, taking the calm blending of two elements in her spirit and what she had witnessed in Nekal's defeat as models for her command style.<br>    Similar to celebrated Vyn-kazi, you have learned to mingle and control the elements that cavort in your body and spirit. Your military training has taught you how to guide a combat to triumph by blending the skills of your allies with the needs and variables of the challenge.

Whether a tool of survival or an implement of battle, the simple dagger has much to recommend it. Even one as small as a halfling can hide a dagger on the body for use in a tight spot.A small body coupled with a small weapon means greater mobility and deadliness enhanced by a better chance for stealthy attacks.<br>    Halflings also have a history of using light blades in their art and performances.

For them, such activities are a natural meeting of physical traits and handy tools.<br>    As with almost every other aspect of their life, halflings have a variety of stories that explain their propensity for using blades. Such yarns include the daring tales of Barras Quickblade, whose surname is probably one of convenient fiction.<br>    Barras's legend begins when he was a lad who provided for his clan by stalking game with nothing but a knife and his wits.

Such creatures provide food, labor, protection, and even company. Only in rare cases does the relationship between master and beast transcend these mundane trappings. Every beastmaster is an exception to this generality, learning to become one formidable unit with an animal that is at once a friend, a guardian, and a weapon. Beastmasters know that, after the bond is formed, the capabilities and fate of master and beast are linked.<br>    Beastmasters among many races have nurtured the mystical connection between master and pet. They cultivated communication that transcends speech and approaches telepathy. As such a beastmaster grew in power, the magic of the world infused the relationship. It bound the animal and mortal closer together, driven to do so by the devotion, ritual connection, and common cause the two shared. Contact among peoples spread this technique, which some claim originated with elves.<br>    Elf or not, you've managed to foster such a transcendent relationship with your beast companion.

If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern's heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren't mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern's mark upon the knight.<br>    A White Horn knight's quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals.<br>    A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns' power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight's abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil.

All dwarves intuitively heed the earth's example, from the sustenance and riches it provides to the inexorable might of the landslide it spawns. Dwarf bodies are durable; more than once they've been compared to the dirt and stone that dwarves treasure. Any would-be dwarf hero does well to take advantage of this natural sturdiness.<br>    Innate toughness is a hallmark of dwarf soldiers and their leaders.

Mighty in body and mind, Bergrom led his troops against giants before dwarves became free from the slavery of the titans. He endured supernatural elements, fell magic, and the treacherous wilds of old to help bring freedom to his people. His legacy endures in a martial tradition that values a sturdy body and the ability to get one's allies to make the most of their own endurance, as much as it does tactical acumen.

Although plenty of other martial paths have more mundane applications, only the gutsy and the venturesome bother to train as giantslayers.

Such a warrior is ever resourceful.<br>    A giantslayer must also acknowledge that gruesome death is a possible end to his or her vocation. This fact, combined with the sheer audacity required for the job, means that most giantslayers are larger-than-life figures.

With Kord and Bahamut at his side, Moradin then used the hammer to shatter the primordial's body.<br>Several other gods wielded Guldarak during the war, and the hammer became a symbol of divine vengeance. Each time the primordials scored a victory against the gods, a god lay a hand on Guldarak, swore an oath of vengeance, and then took up the hammer and carried out that oath.<br>Like Guldarak, you are an instrument of divine vengeance, wielding thunder to smite your god's foes.

Now you face the fire.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, Bravura Presence class feature<br><br>A dragon driven to wrath is a terrifying foe. It stops at nothing to quench its fury in the blood of those who wronged it. Only the desire to protect its young can drive a dragon to even greater heights of recklessness. A dragonborn warrior is little different, and a dragonborn officer displays parental loyalty to those alongside whom he fights. Such is the dragonborn warrior ideal.<br>    An exemplar of this standard was Dhuryan Flamebrow, an audacious but beloved dragonborn mercenary from the fringes of the empire of Arkhosia. Dhuryan was noble born, but upon him fell the consequences of his father's dark deeds. Without title or property in the empire, and living under the shadow of family history, he made his way as a soldier and leader. He made a habit of leading from the front with a brashness born of being indifferent to death. Glory and the erasing of the past was his overriding aim, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his fellow fighters for his own gain.<br>    Dhuryan succeeded in reshaping the armies of a border province known for its barbarism and monster problems. Eventually, that province and its dragon lord became the most prominent in Arkhosia, although only Dhuryan's name is widely remembered to this day. At long last, Dhuryan had cleansed his family name. He rose then to prominence as a military advisor and became a general in the wars that eventually destroyed Arkhosia. During this time, he penned the military manifesto titled Flamebrow, in honor of his clan. Myths from many cultures say that Dhuryan fought in numerous wars in this world and beyond, and that he fell but returned to life more than once. Tales say that he stands now beyond the touch of time, alongside other legendary generals, awaiting the world's need.<br>    Flamebrow still exists, copied into many languages. It is a treatise for the commander who wishes to defeat enemies head-on. Although it speaks of deceptive planning and long-term strategies, it also talks of brutal efficiency and courageous leadership when battle is joined.<br>    Whether through influence, reading and practice, or direct training, your path has been influenced by Flamebrow. Boldness of action fails to fully describe your methods. You act decisively, willing to lay your own survival on the line to get the job done and protect your allies.<br><br><h3>FLAMEBROW COMMANDER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Flamebrow Revival (11th level)</b>: When you are dying, you add your Charisma modifier to any hit points you regain, and you gain a bonus to death saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.<br>    <b>Relentless Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can use your Bravura Presence class feature as if you were your own ally.<br>    <b>Roaring Recovery (16th level)</b>: Each time you regain hit points when you are bloodied, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Flamebrow Assault<span class=level>Flamebrow Commander Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>On your cue, your comrade attacks.

I'll rip up every stone, tear down every building. I won't stop until you and everyone you love are dead.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wasteland nomad theme<br><br>The deserts of Athas are breeding grounds for raiders, brigands, and bloodthirsty savages of all kinds. In a world where it takes backbreaking labor to scratch out a living from the dusty soil and countless people live under the shadow of famine and starvation, many creatures find it easier to get what they need by taking it from others. Most sand reavers operate in small bands, since large tribes can't support themselves on the slim pickings of the deserts. Other reavers move from band to band and region to region, seeking out the easiest prey and most reliable companions they can find. Life among the marauding tribes is often brutal and short; the day a warrior fails to keep up with the march or take his next meal from the tribe's latest victim is the day he is left behind, abandoned to his fate.<br>    As a sand reaver, you are a wolf of the wilderness, a lean and hungry predator. You are familiar with the harsh laws of the desert bands and always ready to react to sudden violence—or begin it, if need be. You are regarded as an outlaw and an enemy to all civilized creatures, and your life is forfeit in any city-state you enter if you are identified for who and what you are. The best of your kind are outlaws with a glimmer of purpose and a rough code of honor, sworn to protect each other and to steal only from those who have goods to spare. The worst are rabid jhakars and ragged kestrekels without a single redeeming virtue. Where you fall on this scale is, of course, up to you.<br>    Whether you chose a life in the desert or found it forced on you, your experiences leave you changed. Your softness, mercy, and empathy are gone, and in their place is only ruthless determination. But your struggles leave you stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand any difficulty you encounter. Above all, you are a survivor, and the wastes are your home.<br><br><h3>SAND REAVER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Bloodlust Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you gain a +2 bonus to any attack roll made against a bloodied target.<br>    <b>Relentless Reaver (11th level)</b>: You add your primary ability modifier to your healing surge value.<br>    <b>Unspeakable Bloodlust (16th level)</b>: Whenever you hit a bloodied creature with a melee attack, that creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Reckless Fury<span class=level>Sand Reaver Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Friend and foe alike must flee to escape your wild rage and whirling weapons.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + ability modifier damage.

The most prevalent among such animals are those from the canine family. Like humanoids, canines have a cooperative mentality and an established social order. It's not surprising that nearly every humanoid race that has the option to do so—from humans to goblins, eladrin to gnolls—keeps hounds or doglike beasts as pets.<br>    Myth holds that, just as humanoids have adopted canines, so too have canines adopted humanoids. One such story is the tale of Kurngarl, or Kurn the Hunter. Soon enough after the fall of the tiefling empire that the hatred of that race was still widespread, unnamed human parents bore a tiefling child. The parents left the babe in an enchanted wood to die of exposure. By some twist of destiny—or, certain versions say, by Melora's fickle mercies—wolves found the infant instead. Yunulf, “the Lady of the Wolves,” added the human child to her litter, naming him Horned Man.<br>    Kurngarl developed uncanny skills with nature while living with his wolf family, learning from a variety of other animals as well. Eventually, a dwarf explorer named Fargrim found Kurngarl and took the tiefling child to the ancient dwarven hold of Durigirn. The young tiefling then became a citizen of the dwarven hold and roamed the wilderness surrounding it. Even so, he acknowledged no dwarven name in place of the one his wolf mother had given him. That he translated literally into Dwarven, accepting only the nickname Kurn as an alternative.<br>    Kurngarl had many adventures, almost all with his wolf brother Grabor by his side. Kurn and Grabor were renowned as hunters and trackers among the dwarves of Durigirn. They are also mentioned in the legends of other races, enjoying a heroic reputation for battling monsters, especially gnolls and giants. Kurn the Hunter is reputed to have turned the animals of the wilderness against unjust people in civilized areas. As such, he is held as an example by Melora's followers.<br>    Despite differences in your life's history, like Kurn, you have a preternatural connection with a canine beast. You and your companion function as a deadly unit among the larger pack made up of your other allies. For its part, your companion has taken cues from you, developing a level of competence and guile rivaling that of some humanoids. You have taken the wildness of the wolf into your spirit.

As the story goes, the family fortune was forged from a source of mercury discovered in one of their iron mines, with the wizards and alchemists of the realm paying handsomely for the rare liquid metal. At some point, though, rumors spread that by digging for more mercury, the House of Methys awoke something powerful in the deeps. Then, the rumors abruptly stopped, possibly because anyone heard prying into the details about the noble house died soon after.<br><br>What most folk don't know is that a clan of twelve mercury dragons served as the source of the Methys fortune. The merchant house drained them of some of their blood, which can be transformed through ritual magic to pure mercury, and then sold the metal to the highest bidder. At first, these mercury dragons were amused that humans would pay so handsomely for their blood, and their hoards grew at the cost of a minute or two of pain. But when they learned that Methys agents had stolen a clutch of a mercury dragon's eggs to harvest for the precious liquid metal, they realized the scope of the Methys family's hunger for power. These twelve mercury dragons, maddened<br>with grief, turned on their business partners and slaughtered the leaders, then used their polymorph ability to assume their identities. Now the Methys dragons have made it their mission to reacquire all of the mercury that came from the dragon eggs by tracking down the sales of the blood using the spotty records the Methys agents kept, plus ensure that knowledge of the ritual used to transform their blood is erased from the world. They have vowed to never again allow another agency to profit from their own blood.<br><br>To help them in this endeavor, they turned to group of dragonborn agents, gathered one by one. Soon after the original members of House Methys were dispatched, the twelve dragons discovered that by infusing their blood into that of a dragonborn, through a painful ritual colloquially called the Infusion, the dragonborn gained some abilities that benefited them in their pursuit of their masters' goal. The mercurial assassins, as these dragonborn are known, are then sent out to hunt down every drop of mercury created from the foul ritual and bring it back to House Methys. They are also charged with tracking down any copies of the ritual that might exist. Assassinating those individuals who have some portion of the mercury isn't a primary objective, but it isn't exactly frowned upon either. The mercurial assassin is rewarded no matter the circumstances.<br><br><h3>MERCURIAL ASSASSIN PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Mercurial Agility (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also take a move action.<br>    <b>Quicksilver Movement (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to speed and a +3 bonus to Stealth checks.<br>    <b>Fluid Shape (16th level)</b>: When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against you, the enemy must roll twice and use the lower result.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Fluid Counterattack<span class=level>Mercurial Assassin Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You become liquid metal and move to the other side of your attacker, striking it before it has time to discover your whereabouts.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy makes a melee attack against you</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You shift 3 squares to a square adjacent to the triggering enemy.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage.</p><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Mercurial Disguise<span class=level>Mercurial Assassin Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your form ripples as if it were water disturbed by a stone, and your appearance changes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Polymorph</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can assume the form of any Medium humanoid, and you disguise your clothing and equipment to reflect this change.

Within that plane, beauty thrives that defies the worldly mind, but so too does evil. Eladrin are as prone to wickedness as humans are, and in a bygone age, the drow were also natives of the Feywild.<br>    In a time long before other great empires, eladrin faithful to Corellon fought bitter wars within the Feywild against the followers of Lolth and other evil fey. These wars culminated in what came to be known as the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower. During that clash, the Corellon loyalists finally turned the tide and a hero was born.<br>    Ossandrya was an eladrin squad commander when the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower began. Drow and demons had taken the mythic site during a protracted battle that saw the eladrin fighting on many fronts. Several fruitless assaults on the enemy-held tower cost Ossandrya's superiors their lives. With reinforcements unavailable, the eladrin commander was forced to lead the remaining troops against the drow. She devised a multipronged attack that utilized the eladrin's fey step, taking the biggest risks on herself and having no regard for the tower's ultimate fate. In the end, Ossandrya's efforts proved successful. Although the Spiral Tower was reduced to a blackened spindle bereft of magic, the eladrin drove the drow out for good.<br>    In time, the Spiral Tower was rebuilt. Ossandrya, who survived other campaigns that drove the drow out of the Feywild, eventually passed from the mortal realm. She is counted among legendary warlords. Within the ruins of the Spiral Tower, her story is recorded. Eladrin warriors across the Feywild study her brilliant strategies and tactics, many of which require fey powers.<br>    You have studied Ossandrya's story and schemes, or you have intuited similar ploys thanks to your fey nature. It could be that some combination of these possibilities influenced your course in life.

Some warriors acquire skill with the bow to avoid close combat. Others do so because ability and purpose lead them that way. Archers work for all sorts of causes, military to mercenary, noble to malevolent. One example is the battlefield archer (Player's Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat.<br>    Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter's purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated.

Although humans and elves cherish this celebrated figure, many other peoples speak of him with reverence. Tales differ about his actual heritage, human or half-elf. It is known that he was born to common folk outside elf lands in a kingdom that would one day be part of the empire of Nerath.<br>    Jarret's natural charm won him friends above his station, including young nobles with little or no chance of inheritance. As a result, Jarret gained martial training and took to forming groups of do-gooders and fortune seekers. His ability to lead these small bands to success against all odds came to be well documented. He and his comrades traveled widely and are credited with making life safer in many places. Jarret's companions seldom left the adventuring life for any reason other than significant wealth; certainly death was not the primary reason.<br>    Jarret wasn't so lucky. He fell in battle against the mind flayers of Thoon deep within the Underdark. No magic could bring him back.<br>    The story doesn't end there, however. Many believe Jarret was reborn as a lad of the same name who grew up in nearly the same place. This perhaps-reincarnated Jarret became an inspiring leader and hero like his namesake. He performed similar deeds, and never refuted claims that he was the same Jarret. Instead, he used the rumor to his advantage, renewing former ties of friendship and striking fear into old enemies. He became known for taking special interest in opposing aberrant creatures, such as mind flayers. Those who knew and loved him eventually dubbed him Jarret the Twiceborn. Yarns say he lives still in the heavens, alongside great generals from times past.<br>    Jarret's accomplishments and methods are recorded in story, history, and song.

To them, something worth doing at all is worth doing better than well—it's worth total dedication of body, mind, and soul. Any task merits mastering to the extent that the very process of doing it, even in training, is beautiful. Further, to the fey mind, combining seemingly disparate arts and joys into one form creates something more beautiful in the end. This is as true of archery as it is of any other activity.<br>    Ages ago, after they entered the world and became separated from the eladrin, elves found it necessary to survive in the hostile wilds. Grace and awareness became their strengths. The bow became their chosen weapon for hunting and stealthy warfare.<br>    The magic flowing in the fey soul has enabled more than one elf to forge a spiritual tie with the bow. Such archers are practiced at engaging targets in dense forests and areas fraught with cover. The sound of an enemy bowstring being drawn or the hint of movement in the undergrowth is enough to draw a reactive shot faster than any intended attack can come. A master of elven archery easily deals with multiple foes, and in time develops the uncanny ability to make arrows literally track their targets. Elven arrows can be said literally to have an enemy's name on them.<br>    You carry on this glorious tradition. Stalking in untamed and dangerous places armed with only quiver and bow, you have become an exemplar of elven marksmanship. Your finely honed senses are second to none, and your aim is ever true. Among the most formidable of hunters, you have a shooting expertise that transcends the mundane skill of other archers. Your spirit reaches out to inform you of the unseen.

All people, from nobles to peasants, enjoy acrobatics shows, whether amid the finery of court or the debris of the street. A few venturesome religious rites, especially those that pay homage to Avandra or Kord, require the skill. Mastery of the body is part of numerous education philosophies, and acrobatics is unmatched in cultivating fitness and balance. Thieves and burglars use the skill to ply their trade. Training is easy to find and widely accepted. Some youngsters attain a level of mastery well before they reach adolescence.<br>    Not to be underestimated is the value of such proficiency on the battlefield. A combatant who is adept at acrobatics can maneuver like no other. The adroit use of the skill opens up advantages that other warriors can't attain and allows the acrobat to avoid being pinned down. Movement becomes quicker and smoother as the acrobat uses the whole body as a tool, rather than just relying on the feet and the legs. It's obvious why some martial training includes instruction in acrobatics.<br>    It's also clear that the adventurer has even more use for acrobatics than a warrior or a soldier does. Explorers routinely face perils that are best overcome with agility, poise, and a sense of one's body. More than one fortune seeker owes life and limb to his dedicated schooling in acrobatics.<br>    To say that of you is a gross understatement, however. It doesn't matter if you came by your skill in a formal academy, from family tradition, or through the school of hard knocks.

They use a variety of methods to acquire this enlightenment. Among these is a cycle of quieting the mind and then returning to physical activity. <br><br>A major aspect of the process is meditation. When the mind is allowed to naturally become still in meditation, it transcends normal mental boundaries and leaves the ego behind for blissful silence. Githzerai refer to tapping this transcendent silence as “knowing oneself.” To them, this is like allowing a field to remain fallow for a season, allowing it to retain and build up the nutrients it would otherwise give away. <br><br>Returning to physical responsibilities and focused training plants seeds in the healthier soil. The body grows more in tune with the mind and the soul. Because it is nurtured in all aspects, the whole organism grows stronger. <br>Work and rest in such cycles bears fruit for the devotee in greater skill, greater peace of mind, and greater accord with the outer world. It is this connection of inner self and outer world that storvakals attempt to master. The storvakal has reached a milestone of personal development such that he or she can command nearby forces and expect a positive response. The storvakal's personal being also responds to adversity more like water flowing around a hammer than a stone struck by the same instrument.

In the hands of a master, its deadliness can be unparalleled.<br>    More complex polearms offer even greater rewards on the battlefield and off.

Because polearms are so common and easily crafted, learning to use one is part of most basic military instruction.

The ability to use a polearm against a variety of foes can seldom be learned through the rigors of soldierly education.<br>    Through your adventures, you have mastered the polearm.

And hit them hard!\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter<br><br>Nerath was a just nation, it is said, but it would be a lie to say that it was built solely through negotiation, the spread of knowledge, and cultural influence. No, as any historian can tell you, Nerath rose on the splintered shields and shattered blades of its soldiers. When an object of conquest doesn't bend, it must be made to bow.<br>    That was the job of Nerath's legions. Those armies consisted primarily of highly trained heavy infantry supplemented by heavy cavalry—the famed knight protectors. Nerath's military traditions were derived from older sources. In what any dragonborn would claim to be fine dragonborn style, a special auxiliary force of devastating light infantry led many of Nerath's assaults. These were the empire's shock troopers. Military historians liken them to similar troops among other cultures and peoples, especially elves and dragonborn.<br>    The typical shock trooper wore chainmail over leather, and carried a longsword and short sword, or dual short swords. The trooper was trained to break the line of an enemy force, moving quickly to kill and wound as many enemy soldiers as possible. If a trooper broke through the enemy line, the job then became direct assault on enemy command positions.<br>    Although Nerath no longer exists as an empire, more than a few of its traditions linger. Numerous fighters and schools of soldiery carry on shock trooper traditions. This is to say nothing of the similar soldiers among other peoples, such as dwarf assault fighters. Any warrior who wants training in this brutal and mobile assault style can readily find it.<br>    You are part of this sudden strike tradition of fighting. Unlike those warriors who form battle lines, you move among your enemies, defying them to strike you down and forcing them to pursue you. Your daring onslaughts confuse and astonish your adversaries. Even so, your guard is never down, especially in your favorite place: the center of a throng of foes.<br><br><h3>SHOCK TROOPER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Deadly Soldier (11th level)</b>: When you wield an off-hand weapon, increase the weapon's damage die by one size.<br>    <b>Footwork Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex until the end of your next turn.

Tempered by suffering and endless labor, and without access to soldierly methods, these dwarves tailored their ways of fighting to their work tools.

Skill in melee is required to stand up to larger and quicker foes.<br>    Revolutionary dwarves took up their hammers and axes. They threw these tools into the faces of their oppressors. Then, hammering and hewing from underfoot, the first avalanche hurlers brought their outsized masters down and escaped to the wilderness.

Dwarves then made war on giants in Moradin's name. <br>    Dwarf clans have maintained the avalanche hurler fighting style across the generations.

Bane sends his followers to conquer and pillage, using war for the sake of unjust gain, wanton violence, or sheer bloodlust. Kord's way is one of accepting challenges as they come and using mastered talents to overcome them. His dogma is one of bravery, strength, and skill. No test of mortal mettle is stronger than the crucible of battle. The glory and fame that Kord admonishes his followers to seek involves striving to win the respect of their fellows for upholding their duty and facing danger with their heads held high.<br>    Warriors and warlords of all sorts esteem Kord. Those who know that fighting is sometimes necessary pray to Kord for favor, rather than to Bane. Such warriors know that it is the fate of a few to stand against senseless destruction and oppression. Kord's followers do so without flinching. They uphold the right to independence that Kord's wild nature demands. When battle is done, revelry, boasting, and toasting— celebrating life and health—are all that Kord requires as thanks.<br>    Numerous schools of military thought use Kord's dogma as part of their philosophy. Leaders must be strong and courageous. They must hone their talents to assure victory and survival in bloody days. Renown should be earned through bold and decisive action that serves as an example to one's comrades. A valiant warlord protects his fellow soldiers by leading from the front and luring in the enemy, as Kord did in older days.<br>    You are a leader who reveres Kord's ways. As such, you have shaped your skills by leading your comrades against many dangers. With a war cry, you fearlessly engage your enemies.

Air moves and flows around us all, it is a source of life, and yet it is capable of wreaking terrible destruction. Hurricanes and windstorms can bring a castle down around a king's ears, or hurl even the greatest hero off a cliff to rocky death below. Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend.<br>    Flight, the ability to send your foes sprawling with gale-force wind, or the power to sweep the field of battle with a boulder-crushing, tree-splintering tornado are all as commonplace to you as a casual wave of your hand. You control the flow of a fight, using your power over air to move your foes like pawns around a chessboard.<br><br><h3>WHIRLWIND GENASI PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Whirlwind Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain the use of the windwalker encounter power one additional time in this encounter.<br>    <b>Whirlwind Breeze (11th level)</b>: When you use the windwalker encounter power, you gain a fly speed of 8 until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Whirlwind Counterforce (16th level)</b>: When you are pulled, pushed, or slid, you can either decrease the distance by 1 square or increase it by 1 square.
